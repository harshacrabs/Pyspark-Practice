Almost by accident, I gave one to my little boy (3.5 years) when he saw me taking one. He immediately liked it and would ask for one from time to time. Okay, they're only a tiny piece of candy and they're sugar free. What harm could it do? Well, then I started using them as little rewards and small incentives to do things. It worked. Finally, one day when I ran out and wanted to pick up some more, I found the Ice Breakers Sours (Mixed Berry) and I started using them. At first, he seemed startled at the drastic change in flavor. Now he loves them, more than the mint. Well, I like them too. I still prefer the mint as a breath freshener, but these little Sours are my boy's favorites.<br /><br />Gary Peterson."

When I freeze the same thing in a traditional ice tray, I don't seem to have that problem (I think because it is flexible rather than ridged, the tray flexes rather than releasing the food)...  things that are more watery like frozen juice are not as hard to get out.

I dont waste a lot of food, if any, and my baby doesnt leave wanting more<br /><br />suggestions to this product and its use:<br /><br />1) I have a small freezer, its not standard size and therefore things freezer burn in my freezer at double the rate. Due to this issue that has nothing to do with the product, I overfill these cubes so that the top is touching the lid and no freezer burn is able to form before I can transfer them over into a freezer bag<br />2) because the cubes are bigger I thaw them out the night before in my refridgerator so that by midday they are thawed all the way through and i can easy heat the food evenly from there.<br /><br />I gave this a four instead of five stars simply because they could have devised a snap lock lid system for the money they are charging and made this an overall outstanding item and also because the price point is a little high, Im sure that its not even close to that much money to put together some silicone! i think baby items should be reasonably priced so that even those that are a little less fortunate can enjoy quality baby products such as a way to freeze food."

Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product.

I decided to try the pill pockets.  For the first month or so, they all loved them, and they made it easy to give the pills.  However, after three months:<br /><br />One cat still loves them.  I have to watch her carefully or she will steal the pills from the others.<br /><br />One cat has figured out how to eat around the pill.<br /><br />One cat sometimes takes them, but at other times just sniffs the pocket and skips it.<br /><br />I have figured out a few tricks that help:<br /><br />There are two types of pockets for cats:  chicken and salmon.  The chicken is slightly larger and more pliable and works better with larger pills.  However, I think that the cats find the salmon tastier.<br /><br />Get another cat treat and stick it to the side of the pill pocket.  Then place the pocket so the treat faces down.  My finicky cat is much more likely to eat the whole thing that way.<br /><br />The pill pocket still helps with the cat who eats around it.  After she eats the pill pocket, it is easier to shove the pill down her throat.  She is more likely to swallow it instead of spitting it out if it tastes of pill pocket.<br /><br />If you have two pills, try to fit them both in one pocket.  Giving the cat fewer pockets will make it seem more of a treat."

I then took another and put in the pill and pinched it close and she gobbled it up.  YEA!!!!!!<br /><br />Kelsy only has 2 teeth and eats only soft food.  This pocket is soft enough and she has no problems getting it down.<br /><br />Another up side is when we go on vacation my sons comes and feeds her.

How gourmet can it be?

We had it as a taco sauce tonight--that seems to be its intended basic use--and it went well; even the Picky Eater I'm married to liked it. It has the spicy part just about right for those of us who want many foods to be a tad on the hot side, but who also want to be able to enjoy the taste of the food more than the heat of the pepper. It's a bit spicier than I thought it would be, but in a good way.<br /><br />I also put some in a small bowl to use as a dip, and that was also quite good. I think next time I will add some finely chopped tomatoes (I have a garden, and it's tomato-plethora time as I write this) and scallions. Experience says it will be good.<br /><br />I think it would make a decent salad dressing, and there I might add some extra peppers, maybe serranos (it's pepper-plethora time, too), and some cilantro--maybe just a tiny shot of olive oil to thin it out a bit.<br /><br />In short, it's one of those items that can stand alone in some things and also make a very useful ingredient. No, it's not an authentic, gourmet, classy sauce; but it can be one of those reliable things that make the lot of the person putting together a meal in a hurry a better one."

As time went along, this product has gone through some changes, mostly to compete with their infamous rival Pepsi (as well as other companies). For a while I had a rebellion against this soda because of them making changes in their taste to match other companies. I guess thats a marketing technique or something, because the goal is to sell more products, and have a higher turnover rate. And for about 3 years, I wouldn't drink this soda. Just about the start of this year I decided to give Coca Cola Classic another try, and thinking they are going back to the older formula (trust me, you can notice the difference). Coca Cola is on the rise once again, and I hope that it will be back on top with their products in the soda industry.

In fact, they ran out at the Firehouse that I generally frequented so I actually came here to find it. Firehouse just wasn't the same without it, honestly. It's pretty hot. I haven't been there for a while, but they rate their hot sauces there on a 1-10 scale, and I'm rather certain this is rated with an 8. It's warm. If Tabasco or Tapatio is too hot for you, you might find this to be a bit ridiculous. If on the other hand, you could bathe your food in those sauces, you'll be fine with this. It's hot but there is definitely hotter stuff out there. A lot of sauces seem to focus on the heat and not the flavor, but that's not really the case here. This stuff actually has a really nice flavor to it. Flavor's pretty subjective, and to be frank, I'm not sure I can effectively describe the flavor. Get one bottle, or try it out if you've got a hot sauce store or a Firehouse Subs around... It's my go to sauce if I'm looking for something that packs a punch.

Instead, you pour it into your glass and mix it with water, it foams up BIG time in an interesting fuchsia foamy color, and then as you mix it it settles down into just a big fuchsia glass of liquid (see my uploaded photo to see what it looks like). The taste in my opinion is not terrible. Pomegranate is kind of bitter to begin with, so if you're expecting it to be some really sweet concoction then you're barking up the wrong tree. This does have a slightly sweet taste, but is more overpowered by the bitterness. If you drink it all in one go, it's really not that bad. But the reason for dropping the product down so low is that, just like the pink lemonade variety, it doesn't work.

From that day on I have been a real fan of coconut water.<br /><br />I doubt the hype about being 'good for diabetes' and other health-related claims (I am diabetic and have found no difference in my blood sugar levels). However, coconut water does wonders at rehydrating the body: much better than Gatorade. Even Zico (which has been much maligned lately) does me great after a hot session in the heat.<br /><br />So, load up on coconut water. When you are overheated and thirsty, any brand will go down great. Keep an eye on the prices, since they seem to vary."

However, this soap foams quite a bit and goes really far - one dab will do you, as the old commercial used to say.  The soap is clean, fresh-smelling and works well.  The scent is not overpowering (my other fear about this product before I tried it)... it's subtle and quite nice.<br /><br />Now, for the only downside... the bottle.  The top of the bottle is curved so it's impossible to stand it on the other end. Why, might you ask, would you want to do that.  The bottom of the bottle is where the product comes out.  Picture yourself in the shower... you've just squeezed out some soap and you need both hands to lather up so you want to put it down MOMENTARILY.  If you could rest it on its top (which, since the product comes out on the bottom actually is like the bottom of a normal bottle), you could then easily access more product if you need it.  However, since you can't rest it on the top because the top is curved, you have to close the bottle, turn it upside down, and then put it down, three steps.  If you want more product, you have to pick it up and then open the bottle again.  Sounds like a small detail, but when you're late for work and just trying to get a quick shower, who wants all these acrobatics with a bottle?  Just poor design and not well-thought through but it's a new product on the market and I'm sure they will correct this going forward.<br /><br />I'm sure a marketing person somewhere \"\"pitched\"\" the top of the bottle as echoing the shape of the classic Dove soap bar (not to be confused with the chocolate Dove bar...)  and therefore suggested its curve.  Clearly they didn't actually take a shower with this bottle.<br /><br />In summary"

Calling it Dove Men+Care Clean Comfort does little to dispell this idea, especially considering how prominently the gentle dove logo is displayed. Yet I put aside my manly pride and decided to give it a try...<br /><br />Using the soap was a new experience. The soap itself is a weird pale blue color, and rather thin. When you start the lathering process, you will find it doesn't really produce a lot of lather, which is a little disappointing. Now, this is compared to the lather of New AXE Snake Peel Shower Scrub - 12 oz which I normally use. I am afraid the Dove Men+Care lather would take extra scrubbing when cleaning up after the weekend car maintenance. In fairness, I haven't tried it under really tough conditions, but I will update this review if I find out otherwise.<br /><br />The scent of the soap was weird, and I hated it at first. It smells a little flowery at times, and musky at others, but overall, the smell is really faint and hard to define. You can hardly smell it. It's a real contrast to those soaps that wake you up like smelling salts. Overall, the scent was ok to me, but the real judge was my wife.

I usually use Old Spice hair and body wash, and I will continue to do so for these main reasons:<br /><br />1. Hair AND Body wash - This dove product is not intended to be used in hair.  Therefore i use it when I have to apply head and shoulders a couple times a week.<br />2. This Dove stuff smells very girly.  My wife likes the smell better than the Old Spice, but I don't.

I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs.  Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.)<br /><br />None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life.<br /><br />That is, until Natural Calm.<br /><br />This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically!<br /><br />Here are the things this supplement has helped with:<br /><br />Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night.<br />Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed.

After being on medication for some time for unpleasant heart palpitations (which never worked too well), I decided to give this supplement a try. In about 2 months, the palpitations were completely gone, and I don't have to take that horrible drug anymore! This stuff is awesome. This was about a year ago. I have come to realize that doctors know nothing about caring for the human body and know very little about real nutrition. Your just a customer to them; they make their money by prescribing dangerous drugs that only mask symptoms but don't correct the problem at its source. Magnesium is so important for the body - you cannot go wrong with this supplement. Most people are deficient in this important mineral because the land is so devoid of important minerals these days, so it's very hard to get from food alone. This is the best magnesium supplement on the market. Don't take those cheap magnesium pills you can get at any store. Most of them don't get absorbed by the body and act only as a laxative. Magnesium citrate, of which this product is, gets assimilated easily. Don't be surprised if other problems your having begin to clear up as well. Magnesium deficiency can cause a lot of problems.

259979,B000NMJWZO,A269ZJHM3IMUWD,Pam,1,1,5,1288828800,Pamel's baking mix is wonderful.,"Enjoying homemade goodies can be quite challanging when you require a wheat & gluten free diet.  This mix makes it so-o-o much easier!  You can make cookies, coffee cake, pancakes, even biscuits.  The Recipes are on the back of the bag.  Quick & easy.  Often times with this kind on diet, you would have to buy many ingredients to mix together as a substitute for wheat flour - that is very expensive & not always tasty.  I highly recommend Pamela's baking mix !!!  I have also used many of her other mixes & they are very good too.  Added bonus is that people who don't have to eat gluten free can't tast the difference.  Pamala's mixes REALLY are that GOOD!"

It makes wonderful Belgian waffles that even non-celiac friends & family enjoy. I use this mix for baking cakes & bread in a bread machine.  This bread tastes better than any bread I've been able to purchase. It eliminates the need of having numerous mixes when storage space is limited.

When you make pancakes or waffles, try gently folding in seltzer/soda/mineral water in place of plain water. It makes them fluffier. I also add a teaspoon of vanilla or almond extract to the mix and top the pancakes with raw blue agave nectar instead of high-glycemic syrups. For the oil (which is necessary if you don't want them to turn out like rubber and stick to the pan) try melted organic extra virgin coconut oil, melted ghee or a nut oil of your liking, like peanut, almond or macadamia nut oils. For an excellent oil with no flavor, try Republic of Tea's Stir-Fry Oil made from green tea seeds. It's excellent.<br /><br />Another plus to Pamela's Baking & Pancake Mix is that there isn't any trans-fat."

Then I saw that the reviews for ' Pamela's Baking & Pancake Mix' were great.  I picked up a bag of it at the local Whole Foods.  I was a little leery at first, because the package said that it is gluten and wheat free, but my leeriness was probably due to my lack of experience with this category of products.  As I did with the Stonewall Kitchen mix, I modified the recipe.  I used two eggs, instead of one.  I used butter ( probably about a quarter stick ), instead of oil.  I used milk, instead of water.  To my great pleasure, they not only were quite delicious, but when I reheated the leftovers the next day, THEY WEREN'T DRY!  Now I know why the reviews are so favorable.

Before I was diagnosed I took great joy in baking healthy whole-grain treats frugally from scratch and loved the nutty fullness that my breads and treats had.<br /><br />Once I cut out the gluten I continued to enjoy some of the other grains out there, like rice, quinoa, corn, and millet.  I have missed bread and pancakes, especially, however, as those were key parts to some of my favorite breakfasts.  At a recommendation I picked up a packet of this mix to try, skeptical of the gummy or crumbly nasty tasting pancakes I might have to be drenching with syrup just to swallow.<br /><br />As we mixed up the pancakes according to directions, I could tell that this was going to be something special.  It had little flecks from the almond meal that pleasantly reminded me of some of my successful whole grain pancakes (not tough dense things that some people consider food).  The texture was smooth and silky.  As they cooked, there was not the slimy looking top that the previously gummy pancakes had.  They were a little different from wheat pancakes, but still looked amazingly good.  There was very nice browning on the bottom after we flipped them over.  When they were done, they looked like pancakes.  REAL pancakes.<br /><br />Topped with a bit of maple syrup, these were such a treat for my poor abused tastebuds.  A fluffy texture, a fine grain, not a trace of gummyness to be found - I was in heaven.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, my search for a gluten-free baking mix stops here.  I have no desire at this point in my life (full-time student, wife and mom to a toddler) to relearn how to bake my favorite foods.  This mix is a great value, easy and so delicious - not to mention it is nutritious - that I am happy to save a place in my pantry for it.<br /><br />Thanks, Pamela's, for such a great product, and to Amazon for carrying it at such a great value."

I bought an entire case (10 boxes of five hippos) and had hoped to give them away gradually over a few months time for birthdays or special ocassions...if I didn't eat them all myself, anyway. I know that they don't have artificial colors, preservatives or hydrogenated fats, so they have a shorter shelflife, but since I still had two months shelflife on the packages I did bring back from Germany, I just assumed I'd get product with at least a couple of months to go. I'm eating one as I write this, and its very delicious though outdated, but I'm still disappointed because gifting now includes having to explain that even though the expiration date has gone by, they're still awesome.

Being that I'm a male who's only 23, I have slowly wanted to switch to more healthy,organic products for my health and body as I recently did with my toothpaste,a fluoride free brand called Tom's of Maine. I decided to do the same with my lotions and hair care products.

The first noticeable thing about the coconut oil is the smell...DELICIOUS. I find myself just opening the top and having a whiff before I'll even use it sometimes. Also,the actual feel and convenience of the product is great. It's a great alternative to high fat butter products. It makes my skin feel smooth and my hair is always soft and my scalp dries nowhere near as horrible as it used to. Really,in this last month,I find it harder and harder to find dandruff present.

I just know that I like the sticky rice that I've gotten from the better Chinese take-out restaurants. I also know that the precooked rice packages I was preparing at home were too expensive and not that good. And it also seemed like a good time to stop eating too many potatoes.<br /><br />So I bought a bag of this rice, a bestselling Aroma rice cooker, and a good rice washing bowl. My selections weren't based on expertise. I just went with things at the top of Amazon's bestseller lists that were in an economical price range. I carefully rinsed enough rice for a dinner party of four, threw it all in the cooker, pushed two buttons, and checked it an hour later.<br /><br />Boy, was I ever amazed. This product produced the best sticky white rice I've had from anywhere--home cooking, take-out, restaurants. It has that nice glutinous quality that allows the rice clump to together in some of the most favorable mouthfuls I have ever had so far as white rice. This stuff is really a keeper. At the rate I'm going through  it, one bag might last 5-6 weeks. And that's for just one person.<br /><br />I guess this rice is good for sushi. I wouldn't know. I just like to load it on a plate, use some salt, crushed peppercorns, and soy sauce, and put something else (like an entree) off to the side. The rice is so good by itself, the entree is almost incidental.<br /><br />So I expect to be buying more very soon and highly recommend this. I also recommend the Aroma cookers, which are quite the bargain right now."

I have been using their dressings for several years.  Not all of their dressings are as good, in my opinion, as the Thousand Island but all will help control blood sugars.  What I like about the Thousand Island particularly is the creamy texture of the dressing and the taste.  You can use it on salads, burger melts or in a low carb rueben wrap. (I use the Santa Fe Tortilla 6 carb wrap)<br /><br />People who complain that Walden Farms products don't taste the same as 'normal' dressings have a valid point and it shows how much we have come to equate 'good taste' with sugar.  One way to check out your favorite dressing or catsup is to look at the ingredients and see how high sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn sugar, is on the list. It is no surprise that sugar is often up there near the top and often listed multiple times. Some dressings produced by major brands, however, have only two carbs per serving.  For many people, myself included, this is a tossup.  In some cases taste and cost may swing toward buying the major brand.  For more selections check at the Walden Farms website and don't forget to check at your local grocery or health food store to compare prices on this brand.<br /><br />Clearly, if you are looking to control your families intake of carbs, the Walden Farms brand is a good choice.  If you know of other brands with zero carbs that taste as good or better please add your comments to this review.  There is nothing I like better than hearing about something that tastes great with zero or low carbs.

There is no accounting for taste and many people raved about this sausage so it is obviously right for many if not most people. Maybe that's why I can't find sausage I like, because my taste is not main stream. I will not purchase this product again, but have nothing against Esposito.

These Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers are a little more involved, requiring you to add water (which hardly seems an onerous task, but these days, who knows what's considered onerous?) and they take about 5 minutes to prepare.  For the slight extra inconvenience, you get fresher pasta, tasting more like 'proper' cooking.<br /><br />The water level line is not as clearly marked, and the sauce cover not as easily removable, as they could be.<br /><br />This particular variety is very tasty.  Packaged pasta sauces often have a harsh, chemical taste, but this one was nice enough.  It's hardly a hearty meal, but it's a good light snack.  If you take microwavable meals to work (or college, or wherever) every day, then you'll want some variety, so you should give this one a try."

The instructions on preparation are very clear, but the water fill line is difficult to see.  However, if you've prepared microwaved pasta previously, you would have an idea of how much water is needed.  The taste is average with the pasta being better than average, but the meat sauce being a little salty.  The serving size is sufficient for most, but the saltiness of the meat might lead to extra liquid consumption.  This is a Healthy Choice meal and its low calorie and fat content are good for those who are dieting or trying to maintain their current weight.  The convenient packaging make it easy to store due to its small size and stackability."

I only fill the glass a little over half way full with water and mix in the half packet of coffee. Then, I pour in my milk, almost to the top of the glass, and add 2 HEAPING spoon fulls of condensed sweetened milk that I keep in a container in the fridge where it'll last for a long time. That stuff is a bit sticky, (as is anything wonderfully sweet) so stir stir stir! With a few ice cubes thrown in to keep it cold, it's perfection!

I suggest refrigerating it before and after use, as mold can grow on syrup (not experienced with this stuff, however).

It is a good substitute and it's fine if you need a way to make pizza for a family that needs to accommodate different diet requirements.  I like that you don't have to let the dough rise first.

So far I've used one whole bag and I couldn't be happier with it. My whole family enjoys eating the food I've made with TVP instead of ground beef, and so far I haven't noticed any stomach issues in anyone, even the baby. (And though I was a little unnerved by another reviewer's comment on the smell, I didn't really notice anything more than a subtle grain scent when I put my nose in the bag.)<br /><br />The first thing I did with my TVP was to take the liquid left from making a pot roast in my crockpot, skim away most of the fat, and use the liquid to rehydrate the TVP. It made a really delicious meatloaf-tasting crumble that we ate in sandwiches with ketchup. A few days later, I made a homemade spaghetti sauce with TVP simmered right in, and that turned out great too. I did notice that the TVP made the recipe just a little sweeter than it would've been, but I compensated with extra spices. I would leave the sugar out of the sauce recipe next time I make it with TVP. And last night, I rehydrated the last cup of TVP in the bag with water I'd mixed a packet of taco seasoning into. It made a very serviceable taco meat substitute for beefy taco macaroni and cheese.<br /><br />Just from my one bag, one quarter of my order, I got three meals for my family, which works out to less than seventy-five cents of TVP per meal. I don't know that I'll ever try to actually make a hamburger with this, but I just love it for any recipe calling for ground beef. Instead of defrosting and cooking a pound of beef, rehydrating a cup of TVP is fast and simple. I will definitely buy this again."

For both, I hydrated the TVP before mixing with the meat.  For turkey italian sausage, I added 2 cups of warm water to two cups of TVP, then mixed with two pounds of ground turkey. To this I added minced garlic, italian seasonings, salt, ground pepper, and fennel seed.  You can also add dried red pepper if you like a hot version.  I let it sit in a covered bowl in the refrigerator overnight so the flavors could blend.  The next day, I browned the whole lot and divided the mixture into 5 quart sized freezer bags.  When I want to make a dish with crumbled Italian sausage, I just pull a bag from the freezer.  For ground beef, I also did a one cup TVP to one pound ground beef mixture, browned with a little garlic powder, salt and pepper, and stored crumbles in the freezer.

Nor should one prejudge, despite the fact that Tuscan is non-vintage and comes in such large containers. Do not be fooled: this is not a jug milk. I always find it important to taste milk using high-quality stemware -- this is milk deserving of something better than a Flintstones plastic tumbler.  One should pour just a small dollop and swirl it in the glass -- note the coating and look for clots or discoloration. And the color -- it should be opaque, and very, very white. Now, immerse your nose in the glass and take a whiff. Tuscan transports you instantly to scenic hill towns in central Italy (is that Montepulciano I detect?) --- there is the loamy clay, the green grass of summer days, the towering cypress.  And those gentle hints of Italian flowers -- wild orchids, sunflowers, poppies. Then, one takes in the thick liquid and lets it roll across and under the tongue -- what is that? perhaps a hint of a nutty Edam cheese?  With Tuscan, you feel the love of every dairyperson involved -- from the somewhat sad and deranged farmhand shovelling steaming cowpies to the bored union milk maiden dreaming of leaving this soul crushing life behind for a job waiting tables for obnoxious American tourists in Siena.  But not too fast -- sip gently, slowly, or one is in danger of not only missing the subtleties of the milk's texture and its terroir, but -- if chilled too long -- also of giving oneself a blinding ice cream headache. Nay, savor the goodness that only dairymen and dairywomen working at the apex of their craft can deliver. Tuscan is best drunk young -- no, no, don't cellar this gem -- I guarantee you'll be sorry if you do.  I recommend pairing with freshly baked macadamia nut scones.

As a college student, I sometimes find myself staying up late to study. I also find myself researching and testing various energy drinks. 5 hour energy, 10 hour energy, monster, venom, bawls, red bull--nothing I've had compares to this product.<br /><br />Hansen's Energy Pro Citrus has a fairly smooth taste, with a little bit of bite. It's not overly sweet and I don't like drinking pure sugar anyways. Speaking of sugar, the ingredients list on the can mentions NO high fructose corn syrup or fructose of any kind--only sucrose and glucose. Amazon needs to update their ingredients information. An interesting ingredient is ginkgo biloba leaf extract, which I've never seen in other energy drinks. The benefits of ginkgo biloba are fairly well researched (google it).<br /><br />Effects may vary, but I noticed an immediate improvement. I no longer felt tired and my mind was ready to go into action. Other energy drinks that I've had will get your body going, but your mind is still tired--not the case with this energy drink. I didn't feel jittery or have trouble concentrating.<br /><br />The cans are the same size as a red bull (not the larger 12oz cans), but the taste is so much better than a red bull.

Irreplaceable of course by the juice we buy that's been packed already. But to compare I bought 3 brands,  the Vita coco, One , and Zico. The first 2 have a distinct taste but both tastes good the only thing vita coco was 100 percent coco juice while one coco juice was gently pasteurized. The packaging was great you don't need a straw to drink right away. I bought the bottled zico and after my first drink the taste of plastic container was very evident.

Why because it is great tasting; but most importantly it is great for you.  It contains more potassium than one banana and only contains 60 calories.<br /><br />Potassium is key and it has 15 times more than sports drinks;  as those of us who have problems with muscle cramping are relieved to know.  I think it is probably the  best natural drink that I have found to promote hydration.<br /><br />I love the natural, the passion fruit and the mango flavors.  All of them taste natural because they are..they are not sweet and the fruit flavors are really only the essence of the flavor itself and are quite subtle tasting.<br /><br />I can't think of a better or more healthy drink...in fact because of its potassium content, I consider it a better drink than plain water.  It also contains a healthy complement of phosphorous, magnesium and calcium with even a gram of protein.<br /><br />Enjoy this drink experience after exercising and you will never feel faint and/or dehydrated again.<br /><br />Bentley/2009"

Zico tastes nothing like any coconut water I've ever had! Its completely flat and whatever taste it does have is almost intangible. Now I really wanted to like it having read some really good reviews (here actually!) and so was thoroughly disappointed. I kept trying to like it, trying it at different temperatures - super chilled, room temp, mildly chilled but still it tasted like nothing. THEN, I read the label - MADE FROM CONCENTRATE! This makes a BIG difference! The flatness of the taste now totally makes sense! I would not recommend this product at all. Seeing all the wildly differing opinions I think either it's a very personal thing or the manufacturers are writing their own reviews:) but so far I've quite like vita coco and Amy and Brian's. Vita Coco to me tastes very genuine but is a little less sweet than Amy and Brian. Amy and Brian's is delicious, it's incredibly sweet despite having no added sugar. Mind you none of these are actually low cal - they still have a good amount of natural sugar. But coming back to Zico, I think of all the natural coconut waters I've had, this is the worst."

Let's start with how awesome Red Leaf Tea is.<br /><br />The customer service is prompt and friendly.  They listen to your suggestions and opinions and take action to please their customers.  It's a sad world when decent customer service is a novelty, but Red Leaf Tea brings some joy back into a bleak world with their courtesy.  Thank you, Red Leaf Tea!<br /><br />Now, this matcha...it's great for beginners!  The price is perfect and you get a good amount of tea so you can experiment with  how you like to drink it.  The basic flavors here are sweet, green and minerally.  THe texture is pretty smooth with only a hint of a powdery texture.  It's a pleasing beverage hot, prepared in the traditional way.  Yes, the quality isn't the best, but it is definitely a good introduction.  It is not bitter at all and completely inoffensive.  I used to be scared of preparing my own matcha because the one time I did it before Red Leaf, it was with a horrible matcha that was extremely bitter.  Now I make myself matcha drinks all the time!<br /><br />After trying this tea the traditional way to fully appreciate the flavors you're working with, you can use the powder to add flavor and healthiness to pretty much anything!  Like the Starbucks green tea latte?  Now you can make your own at a fraction of the cost!  Breakfast smoothie need a healthy caffeine kick?  BAM! Starter Matcha to the rescue!  Want some green tea cookies to go with your green tea latte?  You know where I'm going with this.  :)<br /><br />My favorite way to have this matcha right now is to add it to my Almond milk, banana smoothie.  It was also awesome in my amaretti cookies.  :)<br /><br />Conclusion?  Highly recommended!"

The one positive omission for people like me, who are too lazy to make their own fresh ingredients at home, is that these mixes have no MSG.

Their 'My K-cup' did not have enough thought put into it in order to make it a great item...and perhaps they did this so people would continue to purchase single use, throw-away k-cups, rather then using your own ground coffee in your own reusable k-cup!  I researched both the Ekobrew Cup and the Solofill Cup and then bought both and they are BOTH great!  They both take about 2 tablespoons of your own ground coffee which surprised me since the Solofill is overall smaller then the Ekobrew but that is only the design.  If you fill to the line they recommend for maximum...they used the same amount!  And Even though some reviewers said otherwise...they BOTH empty easily.  The Solofill when you fill it with coffee must be held due to it not being flat at the bottom like the Ekobrew.  Unlike the My K-cup from Keurig, these Cups have hinged lids so when you are done brewing and want to empty the grounds, simply turn the cup upside down and tap a couple times on the counter...shake it, open, dump in your recycle/compost bin, rinse the cups for reuse.  Periodically put in dishwasher.<br /><br />For us, we use the tallest setting, 12 oz, and it's perfect strength.  To get a stronger cup, we push 'brew' and once the coffee begins to stream out, we hold up the handle just a little bit so that the coffee stops dripping out...then we wait about 30 seconds or more...so the coffee can brew a bit longer in the water, then we let the handle back down.  The rest of the coffee comes out and it's a bit stronger then if we let it just pour through without the PAUSE.  Everyone has different coffee tastes so it's fun to sample different ounces in your coffee mug.  I actually find i can run a tiny cup following the 12oz cup and thus fill my travel mug to the top...using the same k-cup.  My husband does not do this but I like to put creamer and mocha flavoring in my coffee so having an extra tall cup is plenty strong enough for me.  I also use half regular coffee and half decaf by alternating the 4 - half tablespoons i use... one coffee, one decaf, one coffee, one decaf.  YUM!<br /><br />Ekobrew or Solofill cups....we heartily recommend either of these 'k-cup' replacements for equally great coffee!"

It takes a while for everything to emerge, but worth the wait.<br /><br />The cilantro grew like crazy - it practically had a tree trunk coming out of its pod and stole the light from poor little parsley.  I think the dominant plant effect depends on 1) the position of the plants in relation to each other, and 2) where the nutrients land when you throw them in.  It's a good thing that the cilantro took over since it goes well it lots of different types of dishes (Thai, salsas, etc.).<br /><br />Both the green and purple basil are full of flavor and make a kickin' pesto sauce.

My sister highly recomended it too me after she did a bunch of research on what dog foods are good for dogs. I like how the first and most ingredient is meat, not corn (we all know corn has no nutritional value and is intigestible to pets and humans).<br />I've been using it for a couple of weeks and my big Lab seems to not like it at all :( He sometimes will go all day without touching it and finally gets so hungry he gives in. I am not sure if this is due to the transition from switching over from Beneful, or if he just doesn't like it. The beneful is now all gone and they are just eating straight Nutrish, so hopefully things will start getting better. I will have to report later after using Nutrish for a while.<br /><br />Update:  It's been about 2 months now and the big lab seems to have adjusted well to this food, BUT he has lost a lot of weight and I can see his ribs. He was not an overweight dog to begin with so the weight loss worries me since there is no medical reason for it. My springerdor puppy is 6 months and loves this food, BUT has the worst gas. I do not allow my dogs to eat human food, so the only thing that would cause the gas is this food. It is a good healthy food, but isn't particularly special except for the main ingredients.<br /><br />I DO NOT RECOMEND purchasing this food from Amazon though, because the prices are absolutely rediculous, I can buy a 28 lb bag from walmart.com for $26 and only pay $3 shipping.

The flavor is good and the grinder works well even having a knob to adjust for coarse or fine grind. The knob turns quite a bit so it's not just a two stage choice but allows for a range. Be careful though as I left the bottle too close to the stove one day and the top melted. The grinder cap came off and could not be reattached. I dumped the salt into a container and I use it whenever I need a pinch. The salt is very coarse obviously but works fine for cooking.<br /><br />Overall I like these grinders as they are nice and big and the adjustable grind is a nice touch. Shop around though because Amazon does not have the best price on these and I was able to pick them up for about half this price locally.

I don't notice any bad smell or aftertaste that always repulsed me when I was a kid and my mom tried to get me to drink powdered milk. As a single person household, it's rare that I can finish off a gallon of milk before it goes bad and I love the idea that I will no longer have to lug up that 8 pound jug of milk up my 31 stairs to my house. I also like the idea of being able to make cheese and yogurt with this powder.<br /><br />Right now, I use this milk for my cereal and my protein drinks. When I want to mix up a protein powder drink, I use 8oz of filtered and chilled water, 1 scoop of protein powder and 2 tablespoons of the powdered milk, cut up a banana into my mixing cup and then use my hand blender and give it a whirl.<br /><br />To reduce on cleanup, I might make 32oz of milk using the hand blender mixing cup add 14 oz water and 1/2 cup of powder milk give it a whirl for 15-30 seconds and put it in a 32oz/quart Rubbermaid leakproof container and then fill up to the 32 oz level and give it a few shakes to finish mixing the quart milk. Then using the my same utensils make my protein drink and one cleanup for two uses.<br /><br />Using a bottle and lots of shaking, I found that it doesn't always fully dissolve the powder until the next day as some have mentioned, but to me, it's not much of an annoyance. If I feel like drinking the milk straight, I might sometimes add a packet of Splenda to 32 oz of the prepared milk and then it tastes better than fresh milk, without adding calories.<br /><br />For my daily use at home to save time, I now make up 10 ready to mix dry protein drinks Baggies at one time. I measure 2 tbls of this dry milk and 1 scoop of my Optimum Nutrition Double Chocolate or Vanilla Ice Cream flavored protein powders. then I simply measure 8 oz of filtered water, coarse chop 1 whole banana and grab a Baggie of my Chocolate or Vanilla pre-measured powder and add it to my hand blender cup and blend it for about 30 seconds to make a delicious, super high protein drink!<br /><br />This product can be awesome for extended backpacking trips of 5-25 days where you can rarely consume enough calories or protein. Most menu plans provide lots of carbs and not so much protein.  For backpacking where you can burn 5,000+ calories a day, I would drink a double load for a quick breakfast drink using a shaker bottle but no fresh bananas of course.<br /><br />Great stuff, save a few bucks by subscribing and after trying it, you can always cancel your subscription if you find this product is not for you.<br /><br />I might try the Saco brand when I run out of the milk, just for comparison, but I cannot imagine that it could taste any better. I have tried other store brand instant non-fat dry milk that was fortified with vitamins A&D bot that gives that reconstituted milk the off flavor and smell."

I have seen others mention they felt other Matouk sauces were hotter, but for me (and heat is a personal thing, some sauces will hit different people differently) this is easily the hottest.  That said, it is still a habanero based sauce and those will only get so hot.  This won't have the kick of a Naga or Butch T Pepper type sauce.

(My dogs are currently eating primarily a fresh food diet that I prepare.) A vet suggested Wysong C-biotic for the pro-biotics, but I believe it also has digestive enzymes that our dog may have been missing. Our older dog had terrible allergies. She was on a variety of meds and even received regular allergy shots.  Adding this to her meals made a significant difference.  It didn't make sense to me, but her old vet (who is not very holistic) said it made perfect sense.  The immune system is based in the gut, and it is the immune system that goes haywire and creates allergies.  Getting the old dog's digestive track working better helped her immune system work more normally. (Not to say her allergies are gone, but it is as helpful as many of the other things we do for her.)

The coffee beans easily overpower the nice, dark chocolate flavor, leaving your taste buds somewhat confused. It is only 62% Cocao but it feels more bitter. I am not a coffee fan at all, but I've always loved mocha-infused anything in my chocolate, but this is just way too strong. It could also have to do with the vanilla beans. The flavors just don't add up as nicely as I imagined. Oh, and another thing to note: If you eat one entire bar, you have reached your entire saturated fat limit-for the whole day! Two servings in a pack= 400 calories. And it's not even that good of a chocolate bar to indulge! And lastly, at $25 for 6 bars- So not worth it."

I took you all at your word, ordered a 50-pack of this coffee on Monday, had my first cup of it this morning, and decided it was worth submitting my first ever review of any Amazon product ever, both to give it a 5-star rating myself and to thank those of you who take the time & trouble to give honest reviews for the benefit of people like me.<br /><br />So for the record, on a price and quality scale this is my new favourite K-Cup coffee.

Spicy and sweet, they are the perfect accompaniment for a barbecue, as a condiment in place of a relish, all by themselves - I think it's a surprisingly versatile food. Imagine candied jalapenos and bread-and-butter pickles together, and that's like what we have in this jar. If you're averse to spicy, this probably isn't for you - it's spicy. But the sweetness brings in an additional dimension, an added richness, and I always find myself wanting to have another taste. The sweetness doesn't diminish the spiciness, nor does the spiciness diminish the sweetness; but they both work together to make for a really robust combination of sensations and flavors. I can't help but think that a little bit of this on top of some cream cheese on a cracker would be all the better... the spiciness and sweetness of these pickles, the creaminess of the cream cheese, and the saltiness of the cracker would make for a real treat.

Which is an amazing treat if you can't have gluten.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />I've found that if you *really* want these to turn out well, steaming them is the way to go. My current favorite approach is to put a layer of water in a big pan, put the hot dogs in the water, stick a steaming insert above the water, put the buns in the insert, and then simmer everything for about ten minutes. The buns can get a bit *too* damp on the outside, but they'll be soft and tasty.

It is rare for any device to work exactly as expected, but the Victor Blackbox Gopher Trap works above and beyond any expectations that I had for it.  I do not work for the Victor company, and I have no financial stake in the sales of their products.  I am simply an exasperated homeowner who got fed up wih gophers tearing up his property and decided to give this device a try.<br /><br />I had used poison pellets, smoke bombs, water hose, and those silly sonic devices... nothing worked and those gophers were probably laughing at me.  With the Blackbox, it's nearly a sure thing.  Also, you actually get to see the results with a dead gopher right in front of you, unlike smoke bombs and poison which are always a guessing game as to whether or not they actually did their job.<br /><br />Within 2 day of getting this product, I had already caught 3 gophers.  One of those gophers was caught less than 1 hour after I set the trap.  Free lunch on my property is now officially over.<br /><br />The key to the effectiveness of this trap is to find a freshly dug up gopher mound.<br /><br />My sure kill method:<br /><br />1) Find a freshly dug up gopher mound.<br />2) Dig out the mound until you find the tunnel.<br />3) Place the activated trap flush with the entrance of the tunnel, with the small round hole (on one side of the trap) facing outward.<br />4) Cover up the gaps at the top, sides and bottom of the trap with dirt so that it looks like the tunnel extends into the Blackbox, but make sure the opening to the trap is unobstructed from inside their tunnel.<br /><br />The idea is to make the trap seem like an extension of the gopher's tunnel, and by instinct the gopher will head towards that small open hole on the other side of the trap to plug it up (they don't like any openings into their tunnels).  Once he enters the trap, it's goodnight Gracie.  This trap is so strong that the gopher will be nearly snapped in half.<br /><br />Before getting the Blackbox, I had also tried using a \"\"Macabee\"\" gopher trap (the one with the 2 pincers that snap together) but the gopher simply pushed that trap out of his tunnel.  The Macabee is also a lot more risky to use and harder to set (in terms of triggering it accidentally on your hand).  The Blackbox is safer to use and much easier to set because the trigger mechanism and the killing device is contained fully within the box itself.  The Macabee trap can also be dragged away by a dying gopher if it is not properly secured.  There is definitely no chance of a gopher dragging away a Blackbox.<br /><br />In summary"

It cooks faster after soaking, although it stays chewy after cooking.  It also takes somewhat longer to cook than wheat, brown rice, spelt or barley -  30-45 minutes.<br /><br />Farro can be used in soups the same way barley is used, or it can be made into an oatmeal type breakfast cereal (yummy with honey or maple syrup), or it can be used as a seasoned side dish the way you would serve brown rice.  It would also be good in cold salads similar to tabbouleh.  It has a nutty, wholesome flavor and is very filling without being heavy.<br /><br />It's an excellent source of complex carbohydrates, and it has twice the fiber and protein of wheat.

This tea does remind me of Earl Grey in flavor and aroma, only it has a more intense flavor.

If you prefer light bodied teas like chamomille without cream or milk, this may not appeal to you.<br /><br />I have never had Taylors of Harrogate before now, but took a chance because I prefer loose tea to tea bags.  My local stores only sell two kinds of Twinings brand of loose tea, English Breakfast and Earl Grey. I prefer more variety.  This was a good buy for the price.

A handful of these is a sufficient pick me up and relatively wholesome, with just around 100 calories. The sugars are low too so even though you feel like you are having something slightly sweet it's really not going to spike your sugars (I think around 3g per serving).

They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation \"\"spices\"\" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste"

I like to take them to movies (in those rare theatres that don't have 'no outside food' signs) to eat in lieu of butter-laden popcorn.

The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth."

He is a very large cat, as the vet has a target weight for him at 18 pounds.  Unfortunately, he has been over 20 pounds since I got him.  While he is not fat, he is definitely in need of shedding a couple of pounds.<br /><br />I had always fed him dry cat food.  He was regularly eating Hill's Science Diet when I got him, and I was reluctant to change.  I thought that some of his minor health problems were just a part of having a cat around.  He tended to cough up massive hairballs, he would vomit stomach bile if he wasn't fed for more than a few hours, and his shedding was ridiculously constant.<br /><br />About six months ago, my vet recommended that I switch to canned food in an effor to keep his weight under control.  I quickly went out and bought a bunch of Hills Science Diet canned food, and he didn't like it very much. So I started to do a bit of research on what was the best food available for cats, and I was amazed at what I found.<br /><br />My research led me to Wellness, and I haven't looked back.  My cat has been eating mostly Wellness now for about three months.  No more hairballs.  No more stomach bile.  His shedding has been reduced drastically.  I have also noticed that his litter box doesn't smell nearly as bad, which I assume is the result of him not being chornically dehydrated from the dry food.  I've also noticed that he doesn't strain as hard to pass stool, which I'm sure he'd appreciate if he understood why.  But the most obvious change is my lethargic and overweight cat now jumps and runs around the house like he's lost three years in age, and he has indeed lost three pounds.  He was at the vet's target weight within a month of starting to eat Wellness, and he has maintained that weight for the past two months.<br /><br />The most important question, though, is how does he feel about it?  He loves it.  When I was feeding him Hill's, I would have to clean his bowl every time I fed him because he would leave pieces stuck to the side that would dry out like oatmeal.  With Wellness, he licks his bowl completely clean purring very loudly while he does it.  His favorite flavor is the chicken and salmon, but I can't stand the smell of the seafood.  So he gets his second favorite, chicken and beef.  He's not a big fan of the poultry only flavors, but he still likes them better than the Hill's he used to have to eat.<br /><br />A few days ago, I actually ran out of Wellness, and I fed him a can of Hill's to get by for the night until I could go buy more.  At 5:00 AM, I would up to the sound of my cat puking up stomach bile.<br /><br />From now on, it's Wellness or nothing."

The powder dissolved easily in my 16 ounce water bottle and the flavor was just sweet enough.  I have a sweet tooth and this stuff was awesome!  But some dumb focus group participants decided that ten calories per packet were just too many calories to allow in their diets each day. Ten bottles adds up to only 100 calories! Really?  Did they only ask anorexics?  The new version clumps in my water and has a bitter after taste.  I have to add my own artificial sweetener to get it to taste like the old version. That's way too much trouble for something that's supposed to be easy.  I even called Gatorade and begged them to bring back the other version along with the new but they said they wouldn't do it.

I used it to bake a cake and frosting for a family gathering.  The cake & frosting was black, but was so delicious and moist.  My family loved it, even though we all joked that we had never seen a black cake.  In fact, a nephew who never eats cake ate three pieces!  When I went back to replenish my cocoa in the silver can for my nightly hot chocolate, the store said that it was no longer available and that the special dark cocoa had taken its place, using the same bar code.  They are nothing alike, and I used them both for different things.  I started mixing regular cocoa with special dark cocoa to make hot chocolate. It was better than using just regular cocoa alone, but not as good as the cocoa in the silver can.  Later, when I went back to the store to replenish my special dark cocoa, that was no longer available as well.  All that I seem to be able to get is the original regular cocoa.  I'm so upset.  I don't know why Hershey's can't have all three. Each one was good for different things.  I even called Hershey's, only to get a weak, noncommital excuse with no solution.

So far, no staining on her bedding at all.

So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised.

The crunch, the salt, the flavors are so addictive.  Not only are they perfect by themselves but they are a vessel for deliciousness. Whether its guacamole, salsa, refried beans, hummus, you name it.  My favorite these days has to be blue corn chips, they have a deeper almost burnt flavor to them which I can't seem to get enough of.  Garden Of Eatin' blue corn chips are my chips of choice.  They have the crunch, the salt, the flavor, not to mention they are organic and GMO free. I got so excited when they went on sale that I ended up crushing some of the bags as I grabbed them.  I feel bad for the person who got the bag of crumbs, I have to contain myself next time around."

It works pretty well for me when I use it in cocktails, and the bright flavor is pretty close to the old homemade method of adding large amounts of sugar to pomegranate juice (but not as concentrated and powerful using the cooked method).<br /><br />So if you don't have the time or inclination to make your own grenadine at home, and like yours brightly flavored, I'd recommend this one."

They're quick to prepare in the microwave, just 2 minutes, so they're great for an evening when we're short on time to cook (they are best served over rice or quinoa, so that does add to the prep time). They are by no means a diet meal, so we consider them a special treat from time to time. They're shelf stable and keep for months, so we keep a supply of several varieties of these Kohinoor meals in our emergency pantry for weather or other emergency use (they're fully cooked, so they can be eaten cold if necessary, and we think they're quite good that way as well).

Definitely better than most nacho cheese sauces you could get in a can. Here's how to turn this into something you'd pay a lot more money for:<br />1. Heat up 6 tablespoons of water in the microwave with 1 tsp of canned diced green chiles for 1 minute.<br />2. Whisk in 2 tablespoons of the cheese sauce mix and whisk until the sauce starts to thicken.<br />3. Put 1 slice of American cheese on top, I use a deluxe or deli style, and microwave for 30 seconds.<br />4. Whisk until the cheese blends in. You now have an awesome cheese sauce with only around 130 calories.<br /><br />Prepared like this, the cheese sauce is excellent over a baked potato or as a dip for tortilla chips. Heck, I could eat it with a spoon. I deducted 1 star because I really feel that this cheese sauce needs the diced green chiles and the American cheese in order to be a 5 star sauce. I probably wouldn't use it often by itself, but with my modifications, it really is delicious and not too high in calories. Plus my modifications don't add much to the price. A can of diced green chiles will set you back a buck and deluxe American cheese is usually $3.50 for a pack of 24 slices."

Some shampoo has been expensive and some has been inexpensive.  All of them have cleaned my hair, but some shampoos have a more pleasant smell than other shampoos, and some shampoos leave my hair softer than other shampoos.  This shampoo seems to be above average with respect to how soft it leaves my hair and the smell of my hair after shampooing.  This shampoo also seems to leave my scalp less itchy than other shampoos.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I opened the shampoo is the pleasant odor.  The odor seems to be floral or fruity; it is hard to tell which.  I did not notice the smell of the shampoo in the shower or the bathroom, which means that the odor is not overpowering.<br /><br />The next thing I noticed is the iridescence in the shampoo.  The shampoo appears much like a metallic paint, and is almost beautiful.<br /><br />I applied the shampoo to my hair and was surprised and pleased at how creamy it was.  The shampoo is much thicker than other shampoos I typically use.  I wanted to keep shampooing my hair because the feel of the shampoo in my hair was so nice.<br /><br />After shampooing my hair, my hair felt very clean and seemed quite manageable rather than limp and lifeless.  The odor the shampoo left behind was pleasant.  It seemed to me that my scalp itched less than it usually does with my standard shampoo.  Even better, my hair felt soft and clean the second day after I used the shampoo.<br /><br />This shampoo has a bunch of miscellaneous stuff that falls under the heading of nutrients and botanicals.  I am unable to tell much about the effectiveness of these various ingredients.  The ingredients sound impressive, but your hair is dead and I am unsure as to the effectiveness of fertilizing your skin.<br /><br />There remains one important aspect to this shampoo, which is the same as for any shampoo, and that is price.  After comparing the price of this shampoo to several other shampoos, I conclude that this shampoo is about average price or perhaps slightly above the average price for most shampoos.<br /><br />Shampoo serves at least one or two useful and important functions.  Shampoo cleans your hair and helps it smell nice.  In addition, shampoo may help keep your hair and scalp soft.  This shampoo also seems to reduce the itch that some people have after using shampoo.  From an esthetic perspective, I think the shampoo is beautiful with metallic-looking iridescence.  The price seems to be competitive to other shampoos.  I think this shampoo has a lot going for it.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"\"healthy"

After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers.

My wife took a bite out of her slice, then put it aside and didn't nibble on it further... that is actually not a common outcome in encounters between my wife and bits of food.

If I had to buy individual packets of yeast at the grocery store, the yeast would cost more than the flour, thereby doubling the cost of each loaf of bread.

Our usual was the expensive brand that comes in the crock and bought this as a whim to not have more crocks and just refill it.  We did not notice any  major difference and the important herb lavender is part of the blend although less noticable as the crock brand when you smell it. For our typical 'confusion ad lib' cooking style it works well if not better.  All the herbes work together as a blend and nothing standing out above the other. This blend will not take a dish to a heavy lavender note and you will have to supplement for that.<br /><br />Obviously one can easily make your own blend at home.  We just find this way more convenient and consistent.  Plus with two cooks in the house we don't have to argue if the blend was made properly or not.  We have been going through this faster since it is a more universally applicable blend for our cooking. Also mixing this with kosher salt makes a very versatile herb salt.

It is the consistency of runny yogurt, so sometimes we add a bit of cereal if we want a more solidified texture - but other times we just let him eat it as is.<br /><br />The color is a light green-y yellow with brownish tones.  Not entirely pleasing to the eye but really - what baby food is?  The smell is just what you'd think - a dominant pear smell with some vegetable smell a little like green bean but hard to identify.  My husband tasted it and he said it was ok but he'd probably not want to eat a whole container of it himself.<br /><br />I like the packaging and ease of opening and dispensing.  My only concern would be package rupture if we were going to take it with us while traveling and if things got packed on top - would it be durable enough to not burst open at the seams?  I don't know the answer to this one.  Glass jars of baby food and even the plastic ones they have out now are very durable for travel and I have traveled with them with great success.  I'd probably take a little extra care with these and not pack them on the bottom of any bag.<br /><br />Bottom line though, is that I would recommend these to friends.

I have some health issues that make baby food a viable option at times, and I gave this a shot. Overall, it's wonderful. The taste is fantastic. The food is pureed spinach, broccoli and pears. There's no added sugar whatsoever, and the nutrition is great. Weird as it may sound, blending it with ice makes a really nice smoothie.<br /><br />Also, each pack comes with a LOT of food. Each individual container should have 2-3 servings, depending on the baby. The product is 100% organic, no preservatives or additives (and the taste proves it. Again, it's actually very good.) The shelf life is a little poor compared to some other brands, but I'd imagine that's the effect of the zero additives.<br /><br />I'm aware that the price is a little steep, but it's worth it if you can afford it.

One is baby food and one brand to offer the organic seal of approval is Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1. Intended for babies age 6 months and younger, this food offers infants the same natural food goodness that adults have been enjoying thanks to the organic/green movement.<br /><br />This baby food is loaded with vitamins for an infant's good health and well- being. The product is kosher and the packaging is BPA free. These are all good qualities for a baby food and they are befitting a product promoted as organic and natural.<br /><br />But what about the taste? If a baby won't eat the food, then it makes no difference how healthy it is. Thankfully, babies do like this food. They eat it just as quickly as they do their other food and they have no problem finishing a full package, which isn't necessarily all that large. The texture is smooth and the digestion appears to be easy.<br /><br />One potential issue some may have with this baby food is its expiration. The expiration date is about five to six months in the future and I assume it is due to the all- natural, preservative free composition. This is a much shorter time frame than that of most canned baby foods, so you have to be careful not to purchase so much that your baby cannot consume it before the expiration date.<br /><br />Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1 is, overall, a very good quality baby food with wholesome ingredients and good nutrition. The cost of about three dollars per container is a tad much, but this is a product of quality and most would agree that price is worth it for the good health of their infant family members."

I particularly like the chewiness of the thing.<br /><br />I made my first batch of Bob's Red Mill Organic Steel Cut Oats this morning. I looked online for a good recipe but in the end I did the most basic thing and I think I will stick with it:<br /><br />How I made it:<br /><br />1. 1 cup oats<br />2. 6 cups water<br />3. little salt<br /><br />Bring water to a boil, add oats, and set timer to 40 minutes on low to medium heat. Stir occasionally.<br /><br />Many recipes called for 3-4 cups of water so I started with 4 cups. However I had to continuously add hot water because the oats were not cooked to my liking. I also found that 4 cups of water was just not sufficient because the oats were starting to burn in the pot. So in the end, 6 cups of water and 40 minutes was best for me.<br /><br />I have to say, even without any flavoring (honey, nuts, cinnamon, etc), the oats taste really good.<br /><br />For consumption, I added some skim milk, drop of honey, and walnuts.

They are also sized perfectly to fit in a large size kong (but easily broken apart into smaller pieces).  My cat also wolfed them down with delight and begged for more.  Being raw they should have many more nutrients than most commercial treats."

Lobsters were shucked yesterday afternoon, shipped overnight (for free), and I had them by lunchtime today. How nice to not have to deal with the mess of shucking the lobsters myself!

After I saw that the tubes were metal  I emailed Amore to ask about BPA.  I give them much credit for repsonding but it turns out these tubes also have BPA so they are no safer than the cans.  I will say this tomato paste tastes better (but not WAY better) than what I get in cans but I don't think it's worth the extra cost.  I get three small cans for a buck at Dollar General and theirs has no added salt which to me makes the DG brand a smarter choice.  If the Amore was organic then I'd say it was worth the cost but it isn't.

I find every other k-cup I've tried (Green Mountain, Newman's, even Starbucks' breakfast blend)to be too watery even on the smallest cup setting but boy these really make it taste like I'm drinking a good strong coffee house cup of joe.  I brew these with a medium cup of water but I think they'd even work with the large size brew. Shame they're so pricey."

To frame how I feel about this Green Mountain Colombian K-Cup I feel it might be best to share how I go about making a cup of Dunkin' coffee when I'm at home.<br /><br />I use a coffee scoop to measure out my coffee.  To my tastes, the perfect home brew is 7 mounded scoops and 7 cups of water.  I put all this in my Cuisinart 1200 and come out w/ 6 cups of java bliss.  I use sugar and milk in my coffee; when I make my coffee as stated it get a satisfying mocha swirl of coffee and milk.  Just by sight I can tell my cup is rich.<br /><br />Now, using that as my baseline, I find this K-cup to be very satisfying.  I have tried MANY kinds of regular coffee K-cups, and this is the first one that makes a satisfying cup of full bodied coffee to my tastes.  Granted, I brew on the 6oz setting.  If you take your coffee black maybe you can get away w/ the 8oz setting.  The cup reminds me of my beloved Dunkin' (note I said reminds, its clearly not Dunkin' but I don't mean that in a bad way).  It doesn't end sharp or bitter like the very popular Coffee People Donut Shop.  It has a muted finish, reasonably full body for a K-Cup, and nice flavor.  When I pour in the milk, I can take more than a drop before turning the cup white - which tells me the cup is rich.<br /><br />Its my go to cup when I'm not brewing a pot.<br /><br />I love this stuff.  I highly recommend it if you like your drip coffee as I describe above.  Why not 5 stars?  Well, it doesn't taste like the Dunkin' I brew from a drip machine, that's why !

Everybody in New Orleans eats it on Mondays, from cab drivers and port workers to businesspeople and Tulane kids.<p>New Orleaneans (native or adopted, displaced or otherwise) know that red beans and rice is a very subtle dish.  The beans at Dunbar's, Mother's, and Ye Olde College Inn (all famous for the dish) are all different, and everybody's mother has her own recipe, too.  There are many variables involved in getting it to come out just right, from the choice of meat to the number of bay leaves to add to the pot.  <p>The most important is in choosing beans.  Red beans and rice cooked by displaced New Orleaneans elsewhere doesn't always come out as creamy as people in the city are used to--often they're thick and starchy and the beans need to be put in a blender to get anything resembling the gravy in the authentic dish.  One reason for this is that Americans outside of New Orleans and the Deep South really don't eat beans, red or otherwise, and the beans sit on the shelf and toughen.  The second reason is that the &quot;red kidney bean&quot; popular in New Orleans is not the same thing as the kidney bean used in three-bean salad or Texas chili.  It's smaller, hence it cooks faster, gets creamier faster, and has a more intense color and flavor.<p>Camellia beans are authentic Louisiana red beans--the small variety--and they're probably the most popular in New Orleans.  They enjoy such a good reputation because they're almost invariably fresh and they produce the creamy pot of beans that, more than any other dish, reminds us of New Orleans."

I grew up on tap water, unfiltered, straight from the hose or sink, and didn't mind it at all.  As I grew older I wanted the mineral taste to the water that you find in tap water, and spring water just seemed so bland and boring that the only time I ever actually liked drinking it was when I had run a marathon and was exhausted and any water would do.  Even now I bring bottled water to work, quickly finish it, and then drink tap water for the rest of the day.  I don't understand why people bring gallons of bottled water to work or the gym, or bring 4 16 oz. bottled water with them.  Made no sense.<br /><br />With Essentia I think I may have been turned.  Maybe it is the pH balance, but whatever they did to the water I absolutely love.  Crisp and fresh tasting, more so than normal bottled water.  I can see myself purchasing this and keeping it stocked.  They do come in rather large size bottles.

Kraft Grated Parmesan, 16-Ounce Plastic Canister (Pack of 3).  Kraft Grated Parmesan cheese has been around since 1945.  The container has been updated, but the cheese is still the queen.  There are more delicious variations, such as freshly grated . . . and now Kraft has a kind with the grater included so we can  grate our cheese to serve it fresh.  I still buy large amounts of the good basic grated parmesan in the refillable green shaker container. It is quick, and most people are in a hurry these days.  It will keep if we leave it on the table when we eat at the cafeteria.  Ususally at home, I keep it in the refrigerator.<br /><br />It is great for a wide range of dishes, including pastas, soups, sauce, snack, bread, and meat. With only ten calories per teaspoon, we can sprinkle on all we want without feeling guilty.  The cheese taste is one I crave, and eating Kraft's Parmesan is a good way to satisfy that craving for cheese.<br /><br /> Perhaps parmesan cheese has been around since the eighth century B. C. or was it developed about 400 years ago in in the Italian city of Parma?  There was a story that near Parma there was a mountain made entirely of parmesan cheese.  On top of the mountain a community of macaroini makers cooked hot pasta, bathed it in butter, and rolled it down the mountain to the hungry people below. There is a legend that it was used by Roman legionniares becaue it lasted throughout their long journeys.  (I found these stories on Kraft websites, and I could not resist sharing them with you.)<br /><br />Some of our recipes in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook and The Collard Patch call for large amounts of Kraft Parmesan.  At my house we use Kraft Parmesan cheese in lasagna, meatballs,  collard tortellini, and casseroles containing collard greens! It's delicious.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful."

At this very moment, the price is almost five bucks a pound for a snack made out of corn.  That is almost double what I pay for the beef shoulder steaks I marinade and grill for my family.  That price is about three times what I pay for the various pretzels, corn chips, tortilla chips, and potato chips that I buy for my family.  That price is almost double the cost of the fancy candies I buy my family, from Snickers bars to Reeses  peanut butter cups.

They REALLY wanted their treats.<br /><br />While the reaction on the chicken-flavored ones is about a four and the reaction on this one is an all-alarm five, I will likely purchase the chicken one in future, just because I hate touching the fish one, and I also noticed the kitties were liking treat time so much that they kept wondering if perhaps treat time might also come now, and now, and at this other time in addition. But you can see - the product does exactly what it's supposed to. The cats love it (it's in big chunks that they can gnaw), I know it's healthy real food with only one ingredient (salmon), and it certainly makes them feel happy and special to get to eat it."

Being a fruit lover who used to eat lots of fruits on a daily basis, I started looking for a safe way to have sweet stuff without feeding the microorganisms that have been for so long attacking my system. After a lengthy research of more than a year, I found out that though most sweeterners FEED bacteria and Candida Albicans, Xylitol DOES NOT. I started using Xylitol regularly and found out, to my surprise, that my worst Candida symptoms were GONE. The symptoms would recur every time I had fruits (darn!)or something made with refined sugar or other sweeteners like Splenda or Stevia, or even the Aspartame that is used on Diet Drinks. Whether I liked it or not, it became clear to me that I could not eat or drink anything sweet, that I could neither have any fruits and that I could not drink any diet sodas.

So far, Natural Temptations Wild Alaskan Salmon Flavor, Natural Temptations Tuna Flavor and All Natural Temptations Chicken Flavor are proving to be three of the rare exceptions.  Just about all the kitties love these things and will follow me around when I'm handing them out so they can cadge more.  Because they are all natural and only 2 calories per treat, they are a reasonably safe and nutritious treat.  Because they are inexpensive, I can afford to bring enough for everybody at every visit!  And apparently they taste awesome.  I can buy these at my local grocery, Target, Walmart or pet store for around $1.50 to $2.00 a packet and each packet contains enough treats to provide every kitty in the shelter with a generous serving of treats. There is one negative - these treats contain a lot of grains and as a result some kitties will vomit them up after an hour (some kitties tummies will not tolerate food or treats containing grain, or more than very small amounts of grain); over the last few months I've had 3 or 4 kitties through the shelter with this issue.  Once I've identified a kitty who is grain-intolerant, I naturally do not feed it these treats or anything similar.

However, after reading the other review, I asked the manager at a local pet food store what he thought of this brand, and he said it was NOT good - all fillers (corn) and animal by-products.  He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content.  (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc).  He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist.  (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.)  Finally, he also said that bully sticks are far better for dogs than rawhide (which are basically like eating leather)."

Most of the time there are just lots of crumbles from the edges of the bars but occasionally you'll find a bar that was jostled around enough to be broken into three or more pieces.

A few days later, I opened the other box of granola bars, which was in better shape than the first one, and the first pack I tried again contained smashed fragments of granola bars.  These are no fun to eat, as you can't really open the pack and pour it into your mouth (I tried), and if you pick out the big chunks you get fragments and powder sticking to your fingers, and on your clothes (and in your beard).

Thankfully that is not the case here.<br />* It mixes very well, and tastes great.<br />* Good price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Only one: it has 200% RDA of vitamin C per serving. Since about 2g of vitamin C in a day is the safe upper limit, that puts a limit on how much you can drink in very long activities.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />* Contains glutamine and BCAAs (2mg per serving). If you have an energy deficit, which you almost certainly will when you drink this, they will probably just be burned as energy.<br /><br />Other drinks all seem to be either a) expensive, b) more sweet than they should be, c) mix poorly and/or taste terrible, or d) full of protein that is not appropriate during or immediately after a workout.

However, it is an excellent compromise cup when I am rushing to get ready for work on weekdays.<br /><br />My only complaint is the new packaging Amazon has gone to with some of the kcups. They used to ship 2 of the original 24 count boxes that have the dispenser cut outs. Now they throw the kcups loose in a big cardboard box. Where I used to be able to stack and store the individual boxes in the cupboard, now I have to find a container large enough to hold 50 loose kcups without squashing them or having to pick them up off they floor when the tumbling out of the cabinet.

I use 1/3 of a serving added to my regular protein powder drink.  I love that this is high fiber- that is why I decided to try it. The taste is unremarkable (my regular flavored protein powder taste remains the main flavor of the shake), but I am so NOT lovng the gritty texture and the way the hemp powder sinks to the bottom almost immediately.  Also changes the color of my shake to a rather unappetizing greenish brown, but that isn't relevant to the taste or quality of the product, but thought I'd mention it as some folks get bothered by stuff like that. Anyway, the heaviness of the powder requires shaking the shaker bottle half to death while I try to drink the darn thing, but I still gave it 4 stars for the fiber and other assorted healthy attributes of the powder, as well as the fact that it has no strong taste, all of which I very much like. I am going to use up all I bought (which is gonna take a loooong time at 1 tbsp a day to get through three pounds of powder!) but I am very unlikely to order again, simply for the gritty texture and heaviness that requires almost constant agitation in the shaker  bottle.

The second part is the fiber, it will make your mornings lot easier, without another fiber supplement. For taste, it is very personal but, hemp is easy to mix in a wide variety of liquids so you have choices, the best idea is to try it for a month or so and see how it works on your body, make sure you exercise to maximize the result."

My store has a nice little selection of holiday foods out for Thanksgiving, you know the stuff, things like packets of mulling spices, pretty jars of marmalade, bottles of sparkling cider and eggnog flavored tea and nestled in amongst the plum ham glaze and cartons of bright green fruitcake cherries were white packages of biscoff, they were a great price too, 25% off!  When I went back to the store two days later to stock up, I found jars of Biscoff spread for three dollars each, SCORE!  So I bought four of them, plus even MORE biscoff cookies.<br /><br />I have enough to last me several months now.  My life is good."

Marinate chicken wings in this seasoning together with raw thinly-sliced onions, then scrape off the onions, grill the chicken wings (strategically using the cover of the grill to give them a smokier flavor), caramelize the onions separately in a skillet, and serve together. It's a bit of work, but makes a magnificent dinner, especially paired with sauteed okra and cucumber-dill salad or raita. The spiciness can be adjusted depending on how much of the seasoning you use in the marinade, so experiment until you find out just how you like it. The flavors are rich and intense, especially if you succeed in grilling the chicken just right so that it's crispy on the outside but tender and juicy within.<br /><br />I was alarmed when I moved last year and suddenly couldn't find this product in any of the local stores. I started looking online, and was equally alarmed to discover what Amazon is charging for it. I'm not sure how they justify the $11.50 price tag (the current list price) when a jar costs less than half that in stores. Other merchants available through Amazon pretend to offer a lower price, but they make it up with ridiculous high shipping. Usually Amazon's prices are very good, so I don't know why this product is the exception. After ordering it here once or twice, I've finally managed to find another online merchant that charges only $4 each if you order six, and applies reasonable shipping to the lot, so I probably won't buy it here anymore.<br /><br />TLDR: This jerk spice rub is amazing and I wholeheartedly recommend it, but presently there are better places to order it online.

Ramsey,0,0,5,1316995200,"Amazing Coffee, Good Expiration Date, In Retail Packaging","Hi.<br /><br />I have been using the VIA instant coffee at the office for a while now.  This is my fourth or fifth order from Amazon for it.  The last two orders have been in modern, retail packaging with expiration dates four to six months in the future (which is fine for me).  I find that the expiration dates *do* matter with this coffee, as it tastes fresher (to me) before it is expired than after (I have had both on hand at the same time and have done a side-by-side taste comparison).  Early shipments were in what appeared to be commercial packaging not for display or retail purchase, and the expiration dates were very close (less than one month in some cases).  I promised myself that if the expiration dates did not improve that I would stop purchasing this product.  My past two purchases have been perfect, so I can only assume that the feedback from these reviews, and fixing whatever bugs there were in the pipeline, if any, has fixed the problem of expiration dates.<br /><br />As far as the product goes, it is amazing to me to taste an instant coffee that truly rivals the quality of what i can make at home with focused effort (grinding, measuring, vacuum sealing, filtering, etc.).  At work the water is of variable quality, so I bring my own spring water, use a cuisinart hot pot (on the green tea setting :-), and in a minute I have a quality-controlled, excellent cup of coffee (or a great Yerba Mate in the afternoon).  Life is good :-)."

I have tried other gluten free brands and Erewhon's was the first that actually tasted great! It tastes better than other popular (gluten) cereals that I have had before my allergies were diagnosed.  It does not taste like someone puffed a lot of air in it or like a card board box. A regular serving of Erewhon's Gluten Free Brown Rice Cereal with some sliced fruit or chopped nuts can actually fill you up.<br /><br />Erewhon's Gluten Free Brown Rice Cereal is fresh and flavorful and does not get soggy when rice or almond milk are added (I would imagine it would be the same no matter what type of milk you used). The best part is you don't have to add sugar or anything else to it for it to taste good.<br /><br />Some of the favorite ways I enjoy eating Erewhon's Gluten Free Brown Rice Cereal are:  plain with rice or almond milk, adding sliced fresh fruit, chopped pecans or almonds or just straight out of the box as a snack. With young toddlers and children this is a great healthy snack to serve them that can also assist them with practicing their pincer grip. :-)<br /><br />If you are seeking a healthier and tasty cereal, then Erewhon's Gluten Free Brown Rice Cereal is for you. With only three ingredients: organic brown rice, organic brown rice syrup and sea salt; you can't go wrong. An added plus is the cost.  With today's rising food prices, Erewhon's Gluten Free Brown Rice Cereal is very competitive and in many cases less expensive than the popular cereal brands.  I highly recommend Erewhon's Gluten Free Brown Rice Cereal for you and your family."

I have three black labs that have a chew product every night to help keep their teeth clean and thought this might be a way to save money and give them something new to chew on. Although the cost was kind of expensive, I felt it was worth trying.<br />I was excited to receive this product after reading all of the reviews. The deer rack was a good 7-9 inches or more long as described, had very little smell, and is very hard compared to something like rawhide or other types of bones one might buy. These antlers were more then twice the size of the ones I seen at local pet stores in the area and only about 1/3 of the price.<br />Needless to say, all three of my girls chewed on their antlers for about 10 minutes and have not looked twice at them again. I might not be surprised if my dogs were picky but I find it interesting since my girls eat anything and everything. Perhaps if your dogs have never had anything to chew on in their lifetime they might like this product. Other then that, the product is a waste of money."

The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World, especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love, until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon, different flavors of cat treats are different prices, even though they are all Temptations, Friskies, Party Mix, or whatever."

I put out the finest wet food and he shows barely any interest. I buy expensive dry food to supplement his main meals. Eh, he could take or leave it. I even tried giving him high-end tuna from a can--the kind people eat--and he hardly nibbled at it. He just doesn't have much of an appetite, or so I thought. When I sprinkle a handful of these treats on a napkin, he furiously eats them all up. When I open the cabinet where I keep them, he comes running from wherever he is in the house. He seems to like all the flavors equally (chicken, beef, salmon - doesn't matter). Temptations is the only food I can count on his eating on a consistent basis. I could never train him or manipulate him with food before because nothing ever motivated him. These treats motivate him. If I need to calm him down for a brushing or a nail trimming, Temptations will work the magic. Thank you, Temptations."

I wouldn't want to eat these things plain, but I really see no need to try.<br /><br />  As far as the fiber thing goes, well, I'll try to stay away from TMI territory, but they work very well.

This new Nature's Path blend is a really tasty combination of sweetened rolled oats, tart freeze-dried strawberry and raspberry bits, and chunks of high quality dark chocolate. The granola is not too sweet, perfectly crunchy, and ideal for eating straight out of the bag, on top of yogurt, or even ice cream. For whatever reason, it doesn't seem to chew up the roof of my mouth the way other granolas have in the past. I do wish there were more berries -- good thing the granola has plenty of character and flavor on its own. Each 30g serving has 14g of whole grains and a modest 6g of sugars (the 'evaporated cane juice' listed second in the ingredients is basically sugar, by the way).<br /><br />If you're the crunchy type (and I am), you'll be glad to know that Love Crunch is certified organic and has a very clean ingredient list. I'd love it even more if the bag were recyclable / compostable and the chocolate were fair trade, but am happy to find that Nature's Path donates to food banks for every bag purchased, up to $1 million. I'm not usually a big granola eater, but I'd happily buy more Love Crunch."

There is no weird artificial aftertaste or sticky sweetness associated with added flavors.  The dark chocolate bits are visible and melt slowly in your mouth and if taken with milk melt easily to make a slightly chocolate-y milk.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Organic<br />+ real freeze-dried berries<br />+ real dark chocolate<br />+ No artificial flavorings<br /><br />Cons:<br />- product breaks easily during shipment, leaving lots of tiny bits and small clusters.<br />- Pricey<br />- chocolate could melt easily during shipment during hotter months.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended for those who like real berries (and hate artificial berry-flavor) and real dark chocolate."

There are 140 calories and 6 grams of fat in 1/4 cup, which is not low fat, but neither is it excessive.

The diuretic did me in on hot, sunny days during a long run or long mountain bike ride. U suffered cramps from built-up lactic acid in my muscles, a new experience for me. I could no longer run 10 miles or mountain bike 20-25 miles without replenishing my electrolytes. Even eating every half hour with water didn't cut it.<br /><br />Enter CytoMax, which I initially received as a freebie at triathlons and races. What a difference! It works great! During the summer, I'll bring along a water bottle filled with CytoMax. Its sodium content is lower than other electrolyte drinks. Its taste is easy to swallow and refreshing, unlike some of the others, too. I haven't suffered another cramp since I started using CytoMax. As recommended by the manufacturer, I drink it 30 min into my activity, and then sip it every so often till it's gone.<br /><br />I've not have a single problem with dissolving or clumping using this technique. The night before, I add about 1/4 cup of chilled water to my water bottle. I add 2 scoops Cytomax. I add more chilled water to make 14 oz fluid. Shake ~30 sec. Refrigerate overnight. The CytoMax granules completely dissolve, leaving no residue using this method. The next morning, if it's hot & sunny, I might add a few ice cubes before I hit the trails.<br /><br />BOTTOMLINE: It works. It tastes good. I'd buy it again."

If you're a big fan of the mushy oatmeal, this is not for you.

A bunch of people are talking about soaking them forever & stuff, but I've found just following the directions on the box (bring to a boil stirring constantly, then cover & simmer for about 12 minutes, stirring occasionally) works just fine.  They have a lot more flavor that rolled oats, and if you're adding raisins or cranberries or anything, you can just toss 'em in about 3 or 4 minutes before the oats are done & they'll be all nice & plumped up when it's time to eat your oatmeal.  They re-heat well, so if you're not a big fan of getting up & cooking first thing in the morning, just fix a big batch & nuke single servings as you need them.

Our favorite is the blueberry vanilla & cashew but Amazon does not offer this combo for some reason. So I ordered the  Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants as well as another type, figuring that even if the kids did not like it my husband would take the remainders to work to snack on midday. Well no one likes this flavor. It consists of a lot of the puffed filler grains used in cheap bars, almost like smaller firmer rice crispies. I even had the box in the car to pull out when the kids were starving as a snack but no go and husband doesn't like them. The other kind I ordered was the fruit and nut delight which everyone will eat, but our favorite remains the blueberry vanilla and cashews."

I wish I had looked this up before I purchased this because I have nine more bars. What's worse, instead of getting twelve bars, my box only came with ten.

This should be called the Peanut, Almond Bar. If one likes to have the main flavor of a nut bar as peanuts, you will enjoy this.<br />The quality of KIND products I appreciate, as well as the low GI, the natural properties, and having a healthier choice.

They do have a hefty amount of nuts and fruit though that sits atop a dark chocolate bed which is then drizzles with more yummy dark chocolate. I get these via subscription through amazon. They are almost always eaten within the first week of arrival. Everyone in my house loves them. Perfect snack to throw in your purse or grab as your walking out the door.
310576,B008JKTH2A,A2IQM22V0QM4I6,Doug Stevens,3,3,5,1316217600,"price v. value: five stars, even with the peanuts","UPDATE: The five stars are for the almond-walnut-macadamia bars, peanuts and all. I gave the cashew-almond-omega3 bars a try later and was somewhat disappointed with them. Not as much flavor. Back to almond-walnut-macadamia bars.<br /><br />I've gone through a few boxes of the KIND bars named for their alleged content of almonds, walnuts, and macadamias. I haven't encountered any of the funny tastes, apparent staleness, or wrappers horribly stuck to the bars, that some reviewers have mentioned. As other reviewers point out, there are a lot of peanuts relative to the content of walnuts, macadamias, and walnuts. But it tastes good nonetheless, and for the price ($1.06 per bar if you buy on subscription) it  strikes me as a good value. This is a relatively high-calorie snack bar (almost 200 cal), but it's also high protein (10g), has extremely little saturated fat, and a relatively low amount of sugar. It's substantial enough that you can easily resist eating a second bar. The bars also contain some worthy vitamins and minerals in amounts sufficient to matter. So far, knock wood, the deliveries on Amazon's subscription have been fast and the product has arrived in excellent condition. I don't expect to get a gourmet no-peanuts bar for this price--it's a good product and good value at this price."

I have it with fruit, cinnamon, and powdered stevia for breakfast. But it's also great as croutons in salad, tossed into soup, and crushed and used as a kind of breadcrumb substitute. Add it to a variety of foods to get your fiber. Much cheaper here on Amazon than in my local health food store."

Not much to it - very simple to follow and great results every time (get a breadmachine with gluten free setting if you want to use this mix). I love the flavor of this bread - not a strong taste at all, which is what you want if you want to make sandwiches. People who expect gluten free breads to taste like regular breads will always be disappointed - there is nothing that will be exactly the same as regular bread, but this one comes the closest, in my opinion. Almost all freshly made gluten free bread mixes will end up in a slightly spongy, damp bread. I always toast mine if I'm making sandwiches and it turns out fine. I don't toast it, however, if I'm eating it as a side with my meal (such as soup), and even my whole family who is not GF loves this bread! I used to be a devout Pamela's bread mix fan (which is also good), but after trying this one I have to say this is the winner hands down. Pamela's tastes fine, but doesn't slice as easily and has a flatter shaped bread -- not the most ideal if you're looking for sandwich bread.<br /><br />This bread also makes nice thicker slices if you're looking for dinner bread. I also use leftover bread for excellent french toast even if it's stale. Makes great stuffing cubes, too. I slice and freeze leftovers, take them out of the freezer and either toast them or leave them on the counter for 30-45 mins before serving and they are perfect. Smaller amounts of leftovers can be used for bread crumbs in recipes if you toast them first (can also be frozen).<br /><br />By the way, I happened to add sliced olives, grated parm cheese, and italian herbs to the liquid before adding the flour, and the bread had a wonderful flavor! Great for dipping in olive oil."

You will need a heavy stand mixer, like a Kitchen Aid.  Don't try mixing it with hand beaters.  The dough is thick and sticky, and it held its shape somewhat, so I am going to use a spatula greased with oil to shape the loaf a bit.  The texture of the bread was a bit like pound cake, but it was delicious.  I stored mine in the fridge, tightly wrapped with two layers of saran wrap.  It kept just fine, but it was gone in three days.  I am the one that needed it to be gluten free.  It was nice to finally have a sandwich.  My eight year old son loved it as well.

It also works perfectly for the latte that I usually make every morning with an electric frother. Since it's made to be brewed, you can make it as strong as you like.  It's rich and delicious and leaves no aftertaste.

I ate it with some fried chicken and fresh carrots and it made the meal more interesting.  Then I thought I'd mix some honey in and it tasted quite amazing.  I am definitely a fan of this sauce and other than using it on its own, I think I can mix it with mayo and have a Mexican flavored salad dressing.  Or stir it in a bowl of chili.

Oh, a bit too much.  But the craving would not go away.  I thought about baking some lemon cookies, but dismissed that idea.  I'm a good baker, but I was not in the mood for it.<br /><br />So I went to the supermarket and checked at the bakery.  I got donut.  Well, I didn't buy donuts; I mean the bakery had no lemon cookies.  Then I checked the cookie aisle.  These were the only lemon cookies I could find.  I was shocked!  And they were on the top shelf at the end of the aisle, where the merchandisers like to place the pricey stuff.  Not that one could miss that green and yellow package, and why do they show a cockatiel?  I was skeptical, but the craving had evolved into an obsession, so I bought them, expecting to be completely disappointed.<br /><br />They are wonderful!  Best new cookie I've tried in many years.  These are sandwich cookies with more heft than Oreos.  The cookie is made short and not too sweet.  The cream is a perfect concoction of smooth, lemony and sweet.  The overall flavor and texture of this cookie is truly fine.  They are unquestionably lemon, but not overbearing.<br /><br />Best of all, these go wonderfully with tea.  There's nothing worse than an overly sweet cookie with tea!  A perfect match with black, green or oolong.  I wouldn't recommend them with a spiced tea.

They are also fairly filling so they could be a good meal substitute if I find myself stuck somewhere and unable to find acceptable food.<br /><br />They are similar to Almond Joy in that they are sweetened coconut covered by chocolate but the similarity ends there.  The ingredient list is short, healthy and organic, and these have no artificial additives.<br />Here's the ingredient list:<br />Coconut, chocolate coating (cocoa mass, cocoa butter, coconut crystals), coconut oil, coconut nectar, vanilla extract, and sunflower lecithin.<br />That's it!  No gluten, no soy, no sugar alcohols nor artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />I have Type I diabetes so I am always a good test for low-carb foods and whether they really are low-carb.  While these bars are not no-carb they are legitimately low-carb.  I ate one bar without taking any insulin to cover and found that my blood sugar rose very slowly, over an hour and a half, by about 30 points.  By comparison, a real Almond Joy would likely raise me 300 points within about 15-30 minutes.<br /><br />For those with Type I diabetes this means that minimal insulin coverage would be needed or, even better, this would make a nice, handy snack before exercise.  For people with Type II or people who follow a low-carb diet, these bars make an acceptable snack.  Just be sure you can only eat one!  ;-)"

I prefer cream cheese to creme fraiche, but I like both. The package was very carefully and thoughtfully packed, with ice packs and cushioning, so the product arrive in perfect condition. It came with a gorgeous little mother-of-pearl spoon, that, while fragile, is beautiful and will be something I look forward to using with guests. It was very pretty. I balked a bit at the shipping & handling price at first, but seeing the care they put into it and realizing it was packaged to keep the the caviar at the absolute best possible condition for shipping without excessive cost, it was worth it.<br /><br />If I had paid big bucks for this caviar, I might have been slightly disappointed--but only slightly--but at the price that is is, I'm totally impressed with the price vs. quality. It was just a 'touch' fishy smelling when I first opened it, but it was also not chilled (I had taken it from the packaging and couldn't wait to open it and see the quality until it chilled--and while it was shipped with ice packs, I live in Texas, and the packs were melted--BUT it wasn't burning hot/melting levels, which it very well could have been--it was just slightly warm) so it had a bit of a fishy smell to it, usually the sign of a poorer quality caviar. But after it chilled, there was no fishy smell to it at all. It was also quite salty--I realize anything with 620mg of sodium per serving is going to be salty, but there is overwhelming and then ordinary salty for caviar, and this one leaned to the 'saltier' side.<br /><br />All by itself, it's just a tad too salty for ordinary tastes. But mixed with the cream cheese or with the creme fraiche, it was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />It also has the nicest 'pop' to it, and that is my favorite part of caviar--that nice little pop to it. The color is quite deep, and it does stain a little, so you'll want to be careful with that. It's really quite gorgeous too, for decorating appetizers or amuse-bouche for guests. For me, I ate the entire jar in two sittings--it was really quite scrumptious. I ordered a smaller jar, because I wasn't sure of the quality, but now that I've ordered and am impressed, I will definitely be ordering a larger jar from them again in the future.<br /><br />If you're wanting a caviar for making a dish, for including in decoration for party platters or appetizers, this is a perfect cost-effective version to get. Definitely worth it. If you're wanting chilled caviar to be served all by itself and eaten straight, this works, but it's definitely obvious it's not as high of quality as some of the more expensive varieties. I did, however, eat it straight myself and enjoyed it--I just wouldn't necessarily use it for a party or dinner guests intended to eat it straight--but for recipes and appetizers, I think it's difficult to even tell the difference. Really good stuff."

All right.,"By the grace of God, unlike Monster or almost any energy drink (including those horrifyingly disgusting and extraordinarily expensive shots of caffeine which carry the not-so-happy side-effect of making you get hot flashes and flush like it's a freaking rash on your face), this actually tastes palatable. In my experience of tasting energy drinks and shots, they almost invariably taste exactly like toothpaste and/or cough syrup. Not only are they disgusting beyond words and are insanely unpleasant to drink for seemingly no good reason, but they almost always have very little of the single ingredient that matters: Caffeine. Any half-educated energy drink consumer knows this is the only ingredient in the entire thing that actually does anything at all. There's 240mg per can in these, versus the usual 120mg (about the same amount of a standard cup of coffee) in other drinks of the same size, which is just not enough for people like me.<br /><br />This stuff actually tastes like a genuine raspberry soda, has a decent kick, and doesn't taste as horrible as anything Monster has ever made or any of the even more unpleasant energy shots that taste identical to concentrated cough syrup, which then, for seemingly almost everyone, give you a blast of Niacin so insanely high that it even warns you of it ahead of time, and by God, if it lasted more than a few minutes, you'd think you'd need an ambulance. And you pay a *lot* for those suckers.<br /><br />This is really the way to go. It tastes good and has a lot of caffeine, and lacks the bad things most energy drinks have.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"\"healthy"

I have often made my own frosting from scratch using these same exact ingredients and I must say that Pamela's tastes very close to my own scratch recipe.  It has more cocoa in it so it has a richer, fudgier flavor than the other two and absolutely NO odd flavors.  None of the three were bad but Pamela's was just better.  One drawback to the Cherrybrook Frosting is that it calls for 2 entire sticks of margarine or butter as opposed to pamela's 6 Tablespoons.

My mom made this and when I was about 11 I started making it for myself.  I have always like this spaghetti dinner.  My late husband was Italian and at first was skeptical of my spaghetti dinner, however he liked it after he tried it.  I am sure he probably liked his mom's homemade sauce the best but he always commented how great my spaghetti dinner was.  He never knew it was from a box dinner.<br /><br />I did mine a little different that the box directions being we had a family of six to feed.  I bought Kraft Spaghetti dinner for the sauce packet.  I would cook a pound of angel hair spaghetti and then brown hamburger, beef stirfry strips or stew meat that I added chopped onions and half of the seasoning packet.  Once it was cooked completely I would drain if needed and then added 3 small cans of tomato sauce (Hunt's) and one large can of diced tomatoes (drained) and the remainder of the seasoning packet.  I would also add about a half of cup of parmesan cheese (Kraft's) while sauce was heating.  Adding the tomatoes to the sauce made it a little thicker and chunkier and made the flavor packet not so strong.  Anyone that tried my spaghetti like this had no idea that it was a boxed spaghetti dinner.<br /><br />I have not made this in a very long time and this is making me miss it even more.  I think there are people who do not like this sauce because alot of Italian sauces have sugar in them which make them a little sweeter than this Kraft Spaghetti sauce.  However by adding the beef strips with onions and tomatoes it does tame the strong spices of using it alone in just tomato sauce.  I also just use about a half a packet when I am using only tomato sauce.  Of course however we make it we always sprinkle Kraft parmesan cheese on our dinner and have garlic bread.  This is my kid's favorite dinner I have ever made for them.<br /><br />I hope my kids can make it for their kids and so on one day.  I am glad to find that I can buy it at Amazon.com.  I will relay that on to my daughter that is in college.  Although, she will probably want me to buy it and supply her with her weekly supply.

An old Greenwich Village burger joint near where I worked at NYU used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer. The memory haunted me for years before I finally picked up a bottle. I shouldn't have waited. This stuff is amazingly addictive with a garlicky sweet hot yumminess that's hard to describe. It sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and I've drained a bottle in a 3 month period. Incredible on eggs, superb on burritos, utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegitable dishes from the Chinese restaurant. I put a squirt in the health low-sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up. Utterly highest recommendation.<br /><br />I, personally, do not buy the 28oz size - even though it's almost the same price as the 17oz size. (it's not a total freebie - Shipping is a bit higher on the 28oz).  While Sriracha has preservatives and doesn't need refrigeration it does oxidize a bit and at the pace I use it the bottom third of the 28oz gets a bit stale for me, while I suck the 17oz down while it's still fresh.

With the various seeds and quinoa mixed in, this was more like trail mix or cereal than clusters, but I didn't especially have a problem with it. I've heard flax seeds are healthy for you and I'd never had them before. For the most part, I'm okay with them, but some of the seeds don't break apart easily once they are in your mouth, and I had more than a few husks and hulls get stuck between my teeth and gums. Personally, I wasn't too happy about that, but other than that, taste was decent, texture was good, (this does make a nice texture enhancer in yogurt), and it appears to be higher protein and lower calorie than your average granola.

I went to my local Petco and picked up just the treats without the ball to see if he liked them and the rest of my afternoon was spent chasing my Rat Terrier/Sheltie mix around my apartment trying to get the treat back.  Needless to say he devoured it after about an hour or so. I picked up the whole kit for about 19.99 at Petco. It comes with the ball and one chicken treat insert. I have read MANY reviews saying how there dog destroyed the ball or removed the treat in minutes. I'm not really sure how that happened as my little guy has pulled up carpeting before and has yet to even make much of a dent in the treat, let alone the ball. At first he was actually so frustrated that he just looked at the ball and whined/barked at us to get it out for him. Eventually I just took the treat out of the ball, let him lick it and chew on it just for about 10 seconds to get a taste for it again, and then I put it back in the ball.  He hasn't quit now for 45 minutes. I stuck some little treats I had laying around in the other side but it seems he could care less.

This treat ball with one of the treats in each side lasted her days with hours of nonstop chewing until I would have to take it away for a while.  She loves it and so do I!  I will say, once there is only a little rim of the treat left along the side you may want to go ahead and take it away because I let her have it past that point and she sorta tore up the rim a bit that holds the treats in because she was trying to get the last bit out.  I think it will still work just fine though for hours more entertainment for her.  Great product!! By the way, for people who say it is dangerous or got destroyed by their dog here are 2 points to consider:<br />1. you should never let your dog chew on any treat or bone like this without supervision<br />2. yes this is a tough product, but some strong chewers will just naturally destroy anything that comes their way no matter how durable it is and that is something you should know about your dog.

He loved the taste of them and due to the design, they were challenging for him to get out so he really had to work on it.

My dogs were totally obsessed with this toy.  My only recommendation is to monitor your dog with this toy and check for signs of wear. Had I replaced the treats sooner (before they had worn down and were difficult for the dogs to get to), I think that my treat balls would have lasted a lot longer.

I enjoyed the light, sweet taste it brought to my tea. However, I do not always use it since it carries 70 calories per serving. Best of all -- as other reviewers have mentioned -- Manuka honey doubles for more than eating.  I use less than half a teaspoon of the honey as a face mask.  First I boil water and steam my face for about 2 minutes, then I apply the honey in gentle, circular motions.  I steam again for at least 3 minutes, then leave it on for 15-20 minutes.

If you're using this on top of cereal or yogurt, then of course it will last much longer.  When the bag is empty, you'll find a bunch of fruit powder left at the bottom.  Don't throw it away, this makes a great topping for yogurt.<br /><br />This snack is not for everyone.  My kids and I love them, but my husband can't stand them.  These are not the consistency of other dried fruits, like raisins.  These are crunchy, just as the name implies.

My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats.

He hates cake so brownies are the compromise. We tried an organic healthy mix, which was the second worst brownie I have ever had, next to a gluten free brownie, as well as all the typical Betty Crocker stuff. Then at Winco, I decided to splurge, because he was buying, and get the Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Brownie Mix for $2.75. We both agreed they were the BEST brownies we've ever had. These brownies are the reason anyone would even like brownies. An added plus, something I strive to look for in all processed foods, is that it has absolutely NO Partially or Fully Hydrogenated anything. About as close to measuring the ingredients out at home as you can get without actually having to do it. I'll be sure to subscribe for Ghirardelli Brownie Mix deliveries every month!

By using smaller quantities of salt, mixed with other spices and herbs, brining can permeate meat with flavor.

Personally, ever so often I take a sip of Rodeo Drive Blend and think that it almost tasted like dishwater. Then that goes away and I enjoy the rest of the cup of coffee. I think that reaction is because it isn't as strong and bold as I'm used to, but it's pretty good. I can see that some people might make this their favorite because it is different.<br /><br />Will I buy this again? No. It's good, but it's not my preference, and I might as well buy the ones that make me rave on and on about how good they are, usually Tully's French, Kona, Italian, and House. Those may be too strong for some people, and the Rodeo Drive Blend does have its own unique taste which may really appeal to some coffee drinkers. As with most things, actually a little more than in most things, with coffee, it's a matter of taste and probably a matter of what you are in the habit of drinking.

It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the paste, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.<br /><br />Ingredients:  tomato, red gram dal (red lentils), salt, tamarind, coconut, coriander, edible starch, red chilli, ghee (clarified butter), cumin, fenugreek, jaggery (raw palm sugar), mustard, coriander leaves, curry leaves, turmeric and asafoetida.<br /><br />The spices are authentic and sometimes I have found a whole curry leaf in the paste.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian but not vegan as it contains ghee.  Note that the label indicates five servings per packet but two or three is much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup.  Note that the nutrition information is for 5 servings per container, which would be a little over half a cup per serving which is not realistic.<br /><br />Calories 45<br />Calories from fat 15<br />Total fat 1.5g<br />Saturated fat 0.5g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol less than 5mg<br />Sodium 900mg<br />Total carbohydrate 6g<br />Dietary Fiber less than 1g<br />Sugars 0g<br />Protein 2g<br />Vitamin A 2%<br />Vitamin C 4%<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 4%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains about 4.5g of sodium."

They taste wonderful - garlicky and cheesy and hot - and they are easy to mix and bake. As an added bonus, they are extremely flexible portions-wise; it is easy to make several small biscuits for a crowd or a few larger biscuits for a smaller group.<br /><br />However, I will add a caveat - I am absolutely addicted to Rod Lobster dinner rolls, to the point that I will often eat there even though I do not much care for much of the menu (I'm not a big fish eater, I'm afraid). These rolls, though very tasty, are not a true substitute for Red Lobster's rolls. These rolls are heavier, and do not have the light, flaky touch that the Red Lobster biscuits have. They are still quite good, but I just don't want someone to buy these in bulk expecting Red Lobster, because you will be a little disappointed.<br /><br />If you want to approximate the Red Lobster taste a little more, I find that sprinkling the rolls with melted butter and a little garlic salt helps. A little of the McCormick Parmesan Herb spice mix also jazzes up the mix, in my opinion.

It was so chewy it stuck to my teeth. Recommend cooking time is 10 minutes but I tried it at 10 minutes and it was uneatable. It was best at 12 minutes - cooked over full flame in a full rolling boil in plenty of water. Be sure to use lots of water. Unlike regular pasta, when cooking pasta made from rice or other flours you can't really get away with crowding the pot.<br /><br />> They claim it has a true pasta-like texture. As an Italian-American from NY who has been eating pasta of all kinds regularly for over 50 years, this isn't like any pasta I've tried before, home made or store bought, and I don't think it has \"\"true pasta-like\"\" texture as they claim.

I always drink mine with milk or cream, too, and even with the addition of dairy, the flavor doesn't get diluted.  Even steeping it for 4 or 5 minutes, it doesn't end up getting that bitterness that oversteeped regular black tea does.<br /><br />As a bonus, for those for whom regular black tea causes the need for overly frequent trips to the bathroom, this is a great alternative.

Years ago I moved to SoCal and my cousin took me to her favorite Italian restaurant. Our waiter brought out the bread basket and plates and my cousin requested that he make us a plate of olive oil and vinegar for us. I watched her as she dipped her bread in it. I thought I'd give it a try and see how I liked it.<br /><br />Oh heaven. How we love you so. Whenever I eat something amazing I feel like it's just a taste of heaven. And taking that first bite of bread with oil and vinegar was like stepping into heaven. Dramatic, maybe just a bit. But when something alerts all of your senses in a wonderful way -- isn't that what heaven is going to be like? (Mine is, anyway!)<br /><br />Cut to going to the store to buy olive oil and vinegar. Hmmmm... it's almost the same. But the vinegar is runnier and not as amazing tasting. In fact I stopped buying it for dipping in bread and just wait until I go out. I haven't been able to create at home the same experience. Until now.<br /><br />Welcome FINI Balsamic Vinegar.<br /><br />It is thick, it is rich and it is the perfect balance between sour and sweet. I add it to EVERYTHING. For example tonight I sauteed some greens and yellow bell pepper. To give it some added flavor I drizzled some of the Fini vinegar over it. It was amazing. Thank you Fini for adding to my veggies.<br /><br />It's sooooo good. And yes, put it with some amazing extra virgin olive oil and an amazing loaf of crusty bread and you too will have welcomed heaven into your life as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

Now, it's available in the U.S. and it's Lavazza.  My local market used to sell it and no longer does but amazon comes through for us.  The flavor is intense but not harsh and has a slight mocha flavor (at least to my untrained palate).  The only negative is my own fault by not noticing that I was ordering a 4-pack, so I have more than I need.  After giving one away to someone who probably won't appreciate it, I'm going to keep the rest and transport myself back to Florence every morning.  The grind is fine enough for an espresso maker but also works for drip makers, although you should use less than usual at first.  It's pretty strong.  Americans are inundated with choices of coffee these days, but I highly recommend trying Lavazza if you're a regular coffee drinker.  The price was very reasonable, even with the shipping.

I am new to loose tea so was a little surprised when I opened the first can to find such fine particles, similar to what you find inside a tea bag. I assumed all loose tea was of the larger, full leaf type. Had I read the other reviews here, I would have known better so my bad.<br /><br />My only complaint about this purchase - hence the 4 star rating - is the expiration date on the tins. They shipped February 8, 2010, with an expiration date of May 28, 2010. Under 4 months? In airtight containers, I expect tea to last at least a year. I understand they have to rotate their stock and these tins had probably been sitting around for 6 months, but it was still surprising and disappointing. As an avid tea drinker, I just finished the last tin so I only went about one month past the expiration date but still, they need to plan their inventory better.<br /><br />If you have yet to try Darjeeling tea, I highly recommend it.

The flavor is indeed lighter like it said, which is nice for a soft pace rather than coffee or soda. The 3.53 ounce tins is a fair size and will last longer than you think. I wanted to purchase the 7 ounce tins, but luckily for me they did not have them in stock. One 3.53 ounce tin lasted a month if not more, for one person, and this is drinking on average two cups per day. So, the 7 ounce tins would be for the whole family. The tin itself looked better than what I thought it would be. The only issue I have with this is the size of the leaves. The leaves themselves are minced, which annoys me for two reasons. One(opinion), it does not make sense to cut them so small. Like what they don't trust people with bigger size pieces? Two(factual), since the leaves are minced, it contains many lesser particle of leaves. And these particle goes right threw the mesh I have and the openings are very small to start with.

Items were packaged well and there was no overwhelming smell when opening the package.  I have 2 dogs and both like these items very much. My issue is the smell while the dogs are chewing on the bully sticks.  I have read on the Internet that some bully sticks do not stink when being consumed.  The claim is that the bully sticks are prepared by draining them of fluids at some point in the processing.  I've purchased these sticks at pet supply stores for between $2 and $4 each.  These are no different.  My personal expectations was there would be less smell, thus the 3 star rating. However, I need to emphasize that the product was delivered quickly which is important.  I'm sure if my dogs could rate these they would give a 5 star rating.  One of my dogs will finish off a stick in about 20 minutes while the other smaller dog may only be less than a fifth through the stick in 20 minutes. From this perspective they do keep the dog busy, and I'm supposing that it is accurate that these treats are much better for your dog than than the rawhide chews. My dogs love those too but get gassy eating them.  I've read that dogs don't digest them very well.<br /><br />I would definitely buy from this source again if I find out that it is a myth that some bully sticks don't stink while the dogs are chewing on them. I've not seen any statement to that effect on any packaging thus far so it very well may be a myth. I'm going to look around a little more for the elusive bully sticks that don't stink."

We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.<br /><br /> I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store.

The instructions says to add it until it's salty enough, and it's about 1/3 salt by weight. So if you know how much salt you like to use, use about 3 times as much of this instead. The mix of flavors is a great accompaniment to meats, vegetables and soup.<br /><br />One of my favorite simple dishes is to peel and cut up a sweet potato into wedges, and pat dry 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts. Heat up 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large cast iron skillet. Add the sweet potatoes and sprinkle Tony's over them. Season both chicken breasts on both sides well. Sear the chicken breasts in the same pan as the sweet potatoes on both sides, then cover, turn down, and simmer until done. It's simple and tastes fantastic.

We continued to feed them this food for about a month to see if it changed, and they still have problems keeping it down.

Her ideal weight is approximately 6-7lbs, however she currently weighs approximately 9lbs (this is my fault, I overdid it on the treats). She loved her Wellness brand super5mix adult formula for small breeds kibble, but I recently noticed the small breeds weight reduction version being sold at PetSupermarket, and decided to switch her over.<br /><br />I was worried she would not like it, as I had once unsuccessfully tried to switch her over to the other Wellness Super5Mix weight control kibble (purple bag, normal sized kibble). Surprisingly she took to the taste of the Wellness Small Breed Weight Control kibble almost immediately. I didn't even need to ween her off of the Wellness original kibble, just gave her the weight control formula and she liked it, no problems with her digestion. The color of the kibble is slightly less brown than the original adult formula, but she did not seem to notice a difference at all. She likes the small size of the kibble, and recently I have noticed that she has lost about 4 ounces... not much but it is a start. Hopefully with exercise and some restraint by me, she will be within her normal weight range, but I am happy I made the switch and will continue to purchase this brand.<br />TIP: My dog is a picky eater, so I sometimes mix a bit of water into the food which causes the food to give off an aroma, which draws her to it. It also makes it easier for her to eat because it softens the kibble. It's also good because it keeps her hydrated... Just an FYI."

Colchicine is made from the ground up stamens of Autumn Crocus flowers and was first developed by the ancient Egyptians.  People have been taking it for gout for centuries.  Fooking FDA.

I have a Vitamin Shoppe nearby that sells their house brand for the same amount and I believe that their's is made by Dynamic Health too.  It's good stuff and I do believe it is helping with the gout.  I've been drinking black cherry juice for a couple of weeks.

I bought this royal canin on amazon simply because my local store was out and my dogs needed it.  I actually fed science diet for 15 years or so and recently switched to royal canin simply because I could not get the science diet locally.  Royal Canin is  a higher quality dog food.  It is how the food is made that make it top quality.  All of these years of veterinary medicine has made me very knowledgeable about quality dog foods.  You would be surprised about what products are and are not top quality.  I always find it amazing when people bash one food over the another because they truly have no idea what a good food is versus a poor brand of food.<br /><br />The makers of Royal Canin have done their homework (research) and do know how to make a well balanced diet.  A balanced diet is key to a top quality product along with ingredient and how the food is actually made.  This product is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.  There is a reason why most veterinarians recommend science diet or royal canin and most vets you see will suggest either.  It is because of the medical knowledge they earned in 9 years of school, the knowledge that goes behind the making of these products.  Most people are ill informed about products and I find it pretty entertaining actually.<br /><br />What everyone should know is these products are recommend because dog goods can say what ever they want on a bag.  That is right, a maker can tell you a product will save your dogs life and it is legal.  Most products whether it be from your local store or organic are not what they seem.  This product and science diet is recommend because they actually have what it is stated on the bag and do what they state.  Vets know this because of the schooling they went to.  I know this because of my experience.  So before you believe everything you read online, listen to your vet they do know what they are talking about.<br /><br />Great product!"

I realize correlation does not prove causation, but the health professionals whom I've consulted so far (which includes my primary) agree that there's a strong possibility that the episode was caused by something in the hemp seed, especially since I do not have a history of these kinds of incidents. I'm going for tests anyhow, and if it turns out that the hemp seed was not implicated, I'll update my review.<br /><br />Still, the moral of the story is, try just a little bit of this and any novel food or remedy before you take a full serving of it, lest you wind up at the ER like I did."

My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.  Also, I noticed on the can that corn was an ingredient.  I asked her about this, considering corn is a sugary veggie and she also wanted Gracie to lose about 3-4 lbs.  She told me that the main idea was to have her eat a canned food that was 8% or less in carbohydrates IN A DRY STATE.  That means, they take the food, dry it out and get the true percentages of carbs, etc.<br />When I did some research on the web about pancreatitus in cats, I found that GRAIN in cat food can bring on and/or aggravate the condition. I read many articles that explained that cats DON'T NEED grain in their diet.  Pet food manufacturers put it in there because it sounds good to us, the pet owners, when we read that the food contains brown rice, etc.  But what's good for us, as we all know, isn't always good for them.<br /><br />I looked at many companies that made Grain-Free food and was very impressed w/Wellness.  They have many varieties that are grain-free.  When I called them to get the percentage of carbs in a dry matter basis, they were prepared and quick to answer w/out having to transfer me 10 times.<br />The food is not inexpensive, but my cat REALLY likes it.  This bout w/pancreatitis occured about 4 years ago. She has been on Wellness ever since and is in excellent health. She is now 14 yrs old.<br /><br />I highly endorse this product.

We'll prepare this oatmeal for breakfast during the week as well but leave out the Drambuie.<br /><br />The texture and nutty flavor of this oatmeal sets it apart from anything else we've experienced. Until a friend recommended McCann's to our family, we'd only stocked various brands of instant oatmeal. Breakfast had been perfunctory with oatmeal as just another option among cereal bars and yogurt.<br /><br />We highly recommend McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal.

My parents eat oatmeal all of the time, but I just couldn't stomach the thought of it.  However, this stuff was part of a promotion, and people wrote that it doesn't taste like Quaker, so I gave it a shot.  I'm so glad that I did, because they are right!  This stuff is fantastic.  To me, it's texture and taste are soooo much better than what I've had in the past.

Initially I purchased the Trapani Sea Salt on a whim.  After I completely embraced the pairing of regional Italian wines with the corresponding dishes moving to Italian sea salt seemed only natural.<br /><br />We have many different flavors of salt in our home.  I routinely cook with the following:<br /><br />1. Sicilian Trapani Sea Salt<br /><br />2. Hawaiian Red Salt<br /><br />3. French Grey Salt<br /><br />4. Celtic Salt<br /><br />5. Scandinavian Smoked Salt<br /><br />6. Kosher Salt<br /><br />A few years ago I would have thought anyone nuts if they told me they used six different types of salt.  Now I search for new types of sea salt with the same enthusiasm that used to be reserved for hunting for new Italian wines.  The next two salts on my list are Peruvian Pink and Oak Smoked Chardonnay.<br /><br />I have been struggling with how to describe the difference in taste.  Sadly, I have not figured out how to describe it other than to say it tastes like Italy.  What makes different salts taste different is the different mineral content within the crystal.  They all taste similar, but different.  It is like the difference between a Chianti from two different wineries.<br /><br />Can I really taste the difference in all these different salts?  No doubt about it, but isn't just me that can taste the difference.  The other members of my family that once thought this a ridiculous practice can also taste the difference.  If you love Italian food and wine, try the Sicilian Trapani Sea Salt.  We enjoy it at our house."

I'd seen the Dingo bones before, but the bright red chicken jerky turned me off. Well, now I was willing to try anything. I first gave her a Dingo Dyno Stix, and watched her devour it over the course of a half hour. She meticulously pulled it apart and ate it until she'd gotten every last bit of chicken jerky. Only part of the innermost bit of rawhide remained. Success!<br /><br />So, she'd had a couple Dyno Stix, so to mix it up I gave her a Dingo Ringo.  More success!  She loved the ring shape, and it took her about 45 minutes to get all the chicken jerky out, so it was a bit more difficult for her to get the jerky than it was in the Dyno Stix.  However, once she'd gotten all the jerky out of the Ringo, more rawhide remained behind that she didn't eat.  I tossed it in the trash.  Despite more rawhide left behind, my dog still had a great time chewing on the Ringo, and I'll continue to buy them.  Also, they're a good single serving size for my sheltie.

Our cat did start eating new bugs and probably grasses/plants when we moved to a new state so she had a flare up of her allergy, but when the weather cooled and those delicious distractions went away, the continued feeding of this Natural Balance food was able to get her back to normal.  Her digestion was never an issue with this food.  And my dogs and other cat seemed to prefer this over their own dry food.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

In this case, for example, there are at least four different listings for Red Hot Blues. The only difference is the size of the bag or the quantity of bags that are bundled together. I am posting this review in those as well because other than one listing, none of the others have any reviews. Hopefully this will be of some help to customers, plus point them toward the main listing (the one with Free Shipping and sold directly from Amazon!).<br /><br /><a href=\"\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQYW0E\"\">Garden of Eatin'® Tortilla Chips Red Hot Blues"

348691,B004GWSWCQ,A3GOEFCWETC23E,C. Perry,77,80,5,1301961600,Bulletproof!,"\"So after having returned not one, but two, of the Cuisinart Keurig brewers due to broken water pumps, I've settled on this commercial grade Keurig OfficePro B145 brewer for home use. I bought the unit from my local Staples for one hundred thirty-nine dollars, tax included. This model comes highly rated by both office and home users, and I couldn't find a single review online complaining of the broken water pump problem that seems to plague many Keurig models. The Cuisinart Keurigs were great, but neither of them lasted beyond the four month mark, which is terrible considering they cost around two hundred dollars a piece. They each just gradually stopped brewing full cups of coffee, and it seemed as though the pump just stopped doing its job of pushing water through the machine. Anyhow, the OfficePro B145 model is bulletproof and every component feels solid to the touch. It does not hold as much water as the Cuisinart Keurig, but I'll get over it. It is also considerably louder than the Cuisinart model as it doesn't have the QuietBrew technology, but I think the QuietBrew technology may be the \"\"Achilles heel\"\" of the Cuisinart Keurigs and other Keurig models as the pumps simply don't last. There are just too many reviews online for many Keurig models complaining of broken pumps. I'll update this review if I experience any problems"
348694,B004GWSWCQ,A17U5VLTR8RE6J,L. Pounds,17,17,4,1305417600,So far so good.,"I purchased this from our local Staples, for about $40.00 less then what is listed here. The one feature of this I liked over the other one I had (can't remember the model #) is that it has a drain feature.<br />The 6 oz setting isn't really needed in our house, we either use the 8oz or 10 oz. Also, it is louder then the other model.<br />In reply to the other review about how it vibrated and made a VERY loud noise when priming, I experienced the same issue, I called the company about that, and what happens is, you have to lift up the reservoir (which is already filled with water) and set it back down. If it's not setting down just right, it can't siphon in the water, which causes that bad vibration and LOUD noise.<br />It has a really heavy duty cord and just seems really heavy duty.<br />I did see it is around $89.00 at the Keurig website, but saw that after I got this from Staples. If you have never owned a Keurig, just keep in mind then once you own one, you WILL be addicted, and, the k cups are pricey.<br />I got this for my 83 year old mom, and now she can enjoy fresh, hot coffee anytime she wants."

I did a lot of research on the various models and found an alarmingly high number of pump problems with most home models. I made the same decision others made and purchased a small office (commercial rugged) system for home use.<br /><br />It shipped quickly and set up easily. After priming it I made a cup of coffee and about a minute after pressing brew I had a fresh cup of coffee. Simple, clean and easy, what more could a person ask for? BTW, this unit makes a little bit of noise, buzzes some and you can hear the pump and air but it is not loud or alarming. The whole brewing process takes a minute and the noises last for 30 seconds or so.<br /><br />The included K-cup selection is nice and I enjoy the variety of choices for coffee, tea and hot chocolate offered in many stores.<br /><br />This brewer will accommodate 20oz travel mug, brewing straight into my mug.  This seems to be a solid unit and I recommend this to others."

Howlin \"\"bookie monster\"\"\"",4,4,5,1345939200,"Eighteen months, still going strong!","There seem to be a lot of folks here who complain about the noise of this machine and while it is noisy, it's a commercial grade product with an industrial style pump in it.  It's going to make more noise than the home style ones and even Keurig says on their website that it's not recommended for home use and isn't UL certified for home use.<br /><br />One person who gave it a one star on here was using the drain feature everyday - apparently they didn't bother to read the instructions on the machine.  The drain button is for storage and cleaning, not for emptying the machine daily.<br /><br />Don't trust the descale light - I'm sure it's accurate but descale the machine every 3-6 months whether the light comes on or not.  Also,  understand your water if you are using tap water and if you're using bottled water, understand it even more.  Our tap water is from a well and is, fortunately, fairly soft - 87 on the total dissolved solids meter (which goes as high as 999).  However, I've tested various brands of bottled water, some of them have been over 200!  So get your water tested or buy a $12 TDS meter from Amazon and know what you are putting into the machine.<br /><br />Ours gets used daily, makes 8-10 cups and is on continuously for about eight hours.  We clean it as recommended, descale it every 6 months because of our soft water and it has performed flawlessly for eighteen months.  Our previous Keurig was a home model, lasted two years and finally died.  I'm hoping this one goes for three to four years at which time I would expect it to die.  One negative reviewer said they were upset their home Keurig died after three years and that Keurig was only giving them a partial credit towards a new one ($70!) - good thing I don't run customer service at Keurig or they wouldn't have liked what I told them.<br /><br />If you're looking for a basic brewer, no bells and whistles other than cup size and auto-off, then this is the machine for you.  It will be (should be?) more durable than their home models and provide the same quality coffee.  There are some complaints online about a plastic taste with this brewer.  Because of that, the first thing I did was thoroughly wash the water reservoir and then did a descale with white vinegar and then a thorough rinse.  Haven't had any taste issues whatsoever.<br /><br />People also complain it's too expensive a way to brew coffee.  They are apparently happy with their Maxwell house coffee in their Mr. Coffee and so shouldn't invest in one of these machines.  To me, seventy-five cents for a cup of coffee to rival Starbucks is money well spent and I get to enjoy it in the comfort of my own home.  Shop around for the k-cups, there are huge price differences online and even in retail stores.  I just bought 108 k-cups of Sumatran for fifty-eight cent a cup shipped to my door."

Discarding the spent leaves, one can see that they are whole: Big, lush tea leaves instead of pieces, choppings, or dust.  But the real winner-take-all prize here is the flavor:  Traditionally, people who enjoy Earl Grey, do so with the beverage very hot.

But that all changed when we found Organix and that's the only brand Autumn will eat.  Now he can't wait until I feed him every morning.

I figured, what the heck, it can't be as bad as they say... I was wrong.  The tower is STUPID and here is why...  The filter that sits inside of the top of the aerator slows down the stream of wine.  If you aren't dead center with that stream, the wine goes to the left or the right of the filter.  Then it drips down to the aeration vents and leaks out and down your tower.  The very first glass of wine I poured, I poured extremely slow as a precaution listed by other amazon members.  As slow as molasses.  But, because my hand barely moved, the wine did what I mentioned it would do if you weren't dead center with your stream.  In my opinion, the tower is just for display and is a piece of junk otherwise.  Just buy the Red Wine Aerator without the Tower and save yourself the ridiculous excitement."

We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.

But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell."

When I saw this was being offered to Vine members, I knew I had to give it a shot--sensitivity be damned.<br /><br />Two days ago, I received my Mojito Mocktail in the mail. I opened a package, poured it into a huge pitcher, and filled it with plenty of water. Upon taste testing, I was semi-impressed. Like another reviewer said, this was like a watered down lime drink. The mint is there, but it's not very strong. I knew it was missing something--and not the booze. Luckily, I had club soda in my fridge, so I poured half of a mini bottle into my glass. Instantly, my drink became a lot more appealing, and hence why the star rating is a 4.<br /><br />By itself, this mocktail is okay (probably 3 stars). With the addition of club soda, it becomes a lot tastier (4 stars).<br /><br />And while I know that this is supposed to be a mocktail, I cannot help but wonder if this would be good with some alcohol in it. I'd test it, but I got my nausea/headache from the aspartame and sucralose after a few hearty gulps which means no more for me.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? Only if you do not have an artificial sugar sensitivity. My family seems to enjoy it though, so while I might not purchase this for myself, I probably would for them... or someone who does not drink alcohol, but enjoys the taste of mojitos."

Where my brother will purchase super expensive brands, and my father will purchase the cheapest brand.... I instead, being somewhat of a health nut and also wanting my pets to enjoy a healthy diet spent hours one day at Petsmart, reading the back of all the bags of dog food wanting to find something natural, healthy, without any chemicals, and to contain some glucosamine (which I also give her in tablet form daily ) and that they like and will eat!  After having spent hours reading all the labels of all different brands, found BLUE BUFFALO to be superior to the rest of their brands.<br />  Knowing that you should not switch dog food for they may get sick, or to do in a transition of time, I must admit while I do stay true to the BLUE BUFFFALO brand, I do go back and forth with the flavors to keep it interesting for the dogs.  I have to stick with non chicken flavors, so my dogs do love the salmon, duck, whitefish, and both longevity ones, in which case I am not sticking to longevity considering I was told by the vet to keep her calorie intake down now that she is 13, so I feel that is fair.  Only issue, is the Longevity for Mature Dogs is 58 online plus shipping, where its generally less at petsmart.  So I am back to going to the store and picking up dog food,  but I will miss those days of finding out to my surprise that it was either the same cost or less to buy online and IT SHIPS TO YOUR HOUSE!!!!! INSTEAD OF GOING TO A STORE, PARKING, RUNNING IN TO PICK UP A 24LB OR PLUS BAG OF FOOD, HAULING IT OUT TO THE CAR, AND THEN INTO YOUR HOUSE------- IMAGINE MY EXCITEMENT TO LEARN I COULD HAVE IT SHIPPED TO MY HOUSE FOR LESS MONEY!!!!!

They were previously on Wellness Turkey and when the cans were recalled I tried this on the suggestion of a family friend since their one cat has the same crystal issues our oldest does.  He eats his prescription dry in the morning and this at night.  Normally he's content to let the other two cats get to their food first and hold back with patience for his own, but with this it is the first time I have seen him muscle away the other two cats to eat.  I'll be sticking with this and the turkey flavor.<br /><br />Also there is no fish in this or the turkey flavor wet or dry foods which is excellent!  My cats don't tend to enjoy food that has fish in it and this is one of the few foods I can find that is both good for them and has no fish.  One of them does not like the peas in the food, he will eat around them, but one of the others eats them when he's done.  So if your cat hates bits of veggies they may not really enjoy it as much.<br /><br />Oh and one more point, it doesn't have that funky wet food smell a lot of other foods (even good ones) have.  I really can't smell it once I stand up after putting it in the bowl."

She also had has no tendency to want to eat this after it was digested (if you know what I mean!) which can be an issue with many weight management foods.<br /><br />I did my homework online and read a lot of online sites before switching.

Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past."

Within just 2 days of him drinking this stuff, he was projectile-vomiting EVERY formula meal, but not the breast milk.  It didn't take long to connect the dots & figure out that somehow it was the formula messing with his stomach.

Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes \"\"just like\"\" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well"

Irreplaceable of course by the juice we buy that's been packed already. But to compare I bought 3 brands,  the Vita coco, One , and Zico. The first 2 have a distinct taste but both tastes good the only thing vita coco was 100 percent coco juice while one coco juice was gently pasteurized. The packaging was great you don't need a straw to drink right away. I bought the bottled zico and after my first drink the taste of plastic container was very evident. That was the downfall for me but just tasting it and taking away the plastic taste on my mind it was good but the taste of plastic ruined it.

Last time he got to pick out a matcha, we ended up with Cola, so this time I thought an alcoholic drink matcha was in order. More sophisticated? Well - more adult anyways ;)<br /><br />He is loving the flavoured matcha as much (if not more!) than I do! This one smelled sweet from the get go - creamy and .. tangy? Smoky? Not smoky! I'm trying to describe what irish cream smells like - it doesn't have the smokiness of whisky - but it definitely is sweet and creamy! I knew it was going to be a real treat - just like the real thing!<br /><br /> What a neat flavour experience! I prepared the matcha straight and thick for the first bowl. In this state I tasted mostly matcha with an aftertaste of sweet cream that lingered after finishing the bowl. It was very creamy and pleasant.<br /><br />Next I tried it over ice with 18% cream and sugar. I thought my eyes were going to roll into the back of my head and be lost forever! This was mine and Mike's favourite way to enjoy it. It's sweet, but because you have control over the amount of sugar, it's not crazy sweet and cloying. You could probably enjoy cup after cup with the only buzz coming from the energy of all that matcha you're drinking!<br /><br />This one is so so good mixed with the Madagascar Vanilla matcha - it just adds a bit of something that takes the creamy flavour over the top. Come St. Patricks day, it would be an awesome drink to mix with mint matcha (Mint is on the way in the mail as we speak!) and hey - it's already green! No need to add any food colouring for your Paddy experience ;)<br /><br />Now - if a Guinness Matcha ever comes out - I know the perfect one to mix it with ;)"

360660,B000LKWSG8,A1CTBRFBC63JJ3,Marshmallow Creme,0,0,5,1344297600,Perfect Texture and Flavor!,"I have cooked this pasta several times and had no trouble with it at all. I have no gluten intolerance, so my use of this pasta started out as experimental, and my continued use is simply based on taste and texture.  I wonder if the negative reviews of this pasta came from people who don't otherwise prepare pasta correctly. I have had no trouble with it, as it cooks like traditional pasta. Generously salt the water, bring to boil and add pasta. Allow the water to return to a boil and continue to cook on full heat until the pasta is done.<br /><br />It's important to note, I suppose, that cooking time varies among all stoves regardless of whether or not the pasta is semolina based or gluten free. How much heat a pot of boiling water receives is going to affect cooking time. As for any pasta, the time on the box should be used only as a guideline to give you an idea of when to check your pasta. Pasta water must be salted, and the pasta occasionally stirred.<br /><br />This pasta may come out too hard if it's not been cooked long enough, I guess. Too soft means it was cooked for too long, (and perhaps that the pasta water was not salted), which is why you taste the pasta before dumping the pot into a strainer. Again, this is true for all pasta, so my guess is people who had a problem cooking this pasta were probably interpreting the cooking time too literally and not sampling a piece before straining. In my kitchen, all pasta colors cooked evenly.<br /><br />When the pasta is cooked correctly:<br /><br />the pasta texture is excellent and very comparable to traditional semolina pasta. In fact, regarding texture specifically, there is little discernible difference at all. My family of regular pasta eaters could not discern between this and regular pasta. I served it with marinara sauce which probably masked the subtle flavor difference. This pasta is made from corn and has subtle notes of corn to it, the way a spinach pasta has notes of spinach: it still tastes like pasta. These are mostly detectable when the pasta is eaten completely plain, but hardly when the pasta is sauced at all. In fact, the notes of corn actually work really well with certain dishes and I would certainly choose this pasta for certain dishes for that very reason."
360673,B0076YVPLG,A1JUBRIZMO0RJV,"\"Steve H \"\"books911\"\"\"",0,0,3,1350432000,"Just Ok, but a Brilliant Idea!","Barilla's new pantry Mezze Penne products are an exciting lineup.  You can enjoy a hot pasta meal in 60 seconds.  Furthermore, the product stores at room temperature, which allows you to take it to work to use in a work microwave, or to have it shipped from a store like Amazon.com without worry in most climates.  This product includes the Traditional Marinara Sauce.<br /><br />The pasta sauce is stored in a bin above the pasta.  To prepare the meal, you peal back the top seal to expose the sauce and allow ventilation.  You heat it for 60 seconds.  Let it cool, remove the rest of the seal carefully, pour the sauce on the pasta, transfer it to a plate should you wish, and eat!  It's fast, and it is simple.  No refrigeration required.  It truly is a nifty idea.<br /><br />The only downside is that they are not the tastiest products.  I have tried the Tomato & Basic, Marina, and Spicy Marina.  It's extremely difficult for me to tell a difference between any of the sauces.  The sauces are not great.  Just ok.  My favorite is probably the Spicy Marina, but it's truly stretching it to call one my favorite and again, to even differentiate the taste between sauces is difficult.<br /><br />In terms of the pasta, it comes out slightly gooey and not as soft as it could be.  Just ok.  There are some additional instructions provided, to add some water to the pasta after the first 60 seconds and cook longer, but these instructions are not completely clear.  I tried this once, and the pasta did not change at all.<br /><br />Overall, a brilliant idea.  With the great storage ability, it's not bad to have one or two of these on hand for a long work day, when you want a simple lunch or dinner fast.  However, in general, I would not want to consume these on a daily basis.  Perhaps, over time, they will improve the product.  If they could include just a slightly higher quality sauce and pasta, it could be a real winner.  Right now, just ok."

The mint leaves are dried and they are a bit weak. When steeped for too long or if too much tea is used, the tea gets very bitter. However, I can put in a spoonful of the leaves in the hot water, and refill or top off the cup two more times without losing major flavor of the tea.<br /><br />This mint teas is wonderful for after dinner. I love the way it seems to settle my stomach. It's become a regular after-dinner tea. I received it as a gift, and while I have tasted some teas with a stronger, oilier mint flavor, this one is nice in that it doesn't have the essential oil floating in it that can sometimes irritate the lips or the stomach. This has the real mint leaves dried in the tea to steep. Adding a few sprigs/leaves of fresh mint to the tea and lightly mottling/crushing them in the cup right before adding the water makes a huge difference and really enhances this tea.<br /><br />But even without that, this is a great tea, high quality green tea, delicate flavor. Just don't use too much of the tea so it doesn't get bitter. As for steeping time, I just throw the spoonful in with the hot water loose, so I steep it the whole time I'm sipping it and it doesn't get bitter or lose flavor at all. I prefer that to using a strainer or bag for brewing. I love drinking tea and herbal mixes loose like that.<br /><br />I think most people, especially for the price, will like this tea if they like mint teas in general."

Both make excellent espresso with lots of crema, which is the brown foam on top of the espresso shot and is formed only when the espresso is made right. I can hardly tell the difference in taste between Illy and Lavazza in Blue, although Illy comes in a specially pressurized can which keeps the coffee fresher much longer after the manufacture date. For the price, Lavazza in Blu is probably a better choice. However, I have only seen Lavazza in Blu being offered by Amazon Marketplace stores and not Amazon directly. That means you won't get free shipping on this item. So I buy Illy on Amazon since it's free shipping and costs about the same as Lavazza+shipping. If this item is offered by Amazon directly in the future, I would buy Lavazza in Blu in a heart beat. Also, I would stay away from the slightly cheaper Lavazza alternatives.

I'm not sure if the ingredients have changed (in quality or quantity) or if it's my cats. All I know is that it's being thrown away on a daily basis, can after can.

It is sturdy enough to be enjoyed with milk or sweetener, yet has little harshness when consumed black.<br /><br />Twinings of London was founded in 1706, and is known internationally for marketing teas of consistency and value. Twinings English Breakfast Tea was originally blended to complement the traditional, hearty English Breakfast, from which its name derives. Twinings literature tells us that this is a blend of Kenyan and Assam black teas.<br /><br />This Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses only small particles that infuse more quickly than whole leaves. This blend approaches full strength within just a couple minutes. To avoid excessive particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.<br /><br />This product is a fine introduction to the world of loose tea, and an attractively priced pleasure. Would I rank it as my favorite tea or even my favorite Twinings? No, but I keep some available for when I want the pleasure of plain ol' tea. (As an aside, I would rank Twinings' Earl Grey a bit higher in quality. It is a whole leaf tea with just the right amount of bergamot orange flavoring. I personally don't think of Earl Grey as an everyday tea, but I enjoy it as an occasional pleasure.)"

This does taste a lot like the popcorn at the movies.  If you like your popcorn very salty, this is the product for you!  However, I don't!  I like more butter flavor and only a little salt.  It's simple enough to snip off a small corner of the popcorn side of the packet and pour out most of the salt.  Unfortunately, out of the 20 packets I bought, six of them were not separated properly and the salt and kernels mixed with the oil, so I am stuck with the six overly salty bowls of popcorn.  I really wish this company made a low salt or unsalted version of these packs.  I'd definitely buy more if I didn't have to taste all that salt!"

I use one or two a day and always have a bowl of popped corn out for my grand kids. When ever they come over they always head to the snack shack (a little stand alone cupboard)for a treat. We try to have healthy treats but I think the pop corn is probably more healthy than the granola bars,crackers,cookies or dried fruit snacks and they seem to like the pop corn best.

Daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie/day person is 16. You would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn.

They list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. Most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. I asked Great Northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. They refused. It tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. In some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. I love popcorn. But health is a concern to me. If you are concerned about saturated fats, look at the nutritional guide for these packets."

The only negative is this is too salty. I do not know if it has to do with popcorn popper (it seems to have a large number of un-popped kernels)or just too much salt. We compensate by adding 50% more popcorn to the popper and this produces a much better product.

I like the idea of the oil on one side and the popcorn on the other, very much like I remember the old TV Time popcorn from when I was a kid. I popped up the first bag, but I found there was way too much salt for me. The next batch, I clipped a small corner of the popcorn side off and removed most of the salt. Now, the popcorn is just the way I like it and I added just a bit of butter. Try it first and then see if the salt/seasoning is too much for you - it was very easy to remove. I found that the 2.5 size was perfect for one, maybe two people, but truthfully, I can eat all of it by myself while watching a movie."

But this tea is completely different.<br /><br />I love licorice. This tastes exactly like licorice.

When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers."

After peeling off the label, I realized that the jar had scratches in the glass on the INSIDE of the jar, with the serious potential for having glass particles mixed in with the salt.  I went to the next jar.  It is still safety sealed and unopened.  I peeled off the paper label from the outside of the jar, and inside the sealed jar there is a hair!  It looks like it could be a rat hair, but I have not tested it obviously.  I do hope the FDA will test it--I am contacting them in the morning.  This second jar also has numerous scratches in the glass--approximately 20 scratches, many of them black (dirt in the scratched glass).  The company was not at all concerned--they just told me if I didn't purchase it directly from them, I should ask amazon for a refund.  I explained that the main point of my call was certainly not for a refund but to protect consumers from DANGER!  They called me back and said IF I returned their jars, they would replace the salt.  I refused the replacement and am hoping the FDA will examine the jars.  It is a little alarming that Amazon has no procedure for pulling the salt from its shelves and checking the remaining jars.

I have experienced 15-20+% weight loss, explosive diarreha, vomitting, lethargy. etc.  I have 5 dogs - 60-100+ lbs, varying pedigrees, ages 1 to 12+ - all sick (15-20% weight loss, poor coats, vomitting, etc.).  I have had to run complete extensive blood panels to rule out other health problems on all the dogs - bottomline - blood panels were OK, food (Canidae) was the issue.  What use to be a fantastic food is now a very dangerous food to feed.  An entire pack of dogs' health declined on the 'new' formula.  I switched foods (something other than Canidae) and my dogs are now recovering.  If you love Las Vegas and Russian Roulette feed Canidae - if want to avoid major Vet expenses and heartache choose another food.

There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption.  Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.

I eat only organic foods, practice CRON (calorie restriction with optimal nutrition), eat minimal carbs and lots of nutrients. I've tested 4 other brands of organic coconut oil -- Nutiva, Spectrum Naturals, and 2 small scale raw food companies. This one is easily the best so far.<br /><br />The aroma is wonderful and the texture is much fuller than the other brands. This coconut oil has fuller taste and less watered-down feeling than the other brands. So if you're looking for a good organic coconut oil, this is the one.<br /><br />Now for some quick facts about how amazingly healthy this stuff is:<br /><br />1) Medium chain fatty acids --> Digest very easily without requiring the gall bladder to do much. Great for people missing gallbladders and truly everyone.<br /><br />2) Converts to usable energy very quickly. A much more balanced and less manic energy than any carbohydrate (fructose, lactose, glucose, etc)<br /><br />3) Anti-viral, anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal. Keeps your digestive system very clean inside. Helps destroy candida and balance intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Helps the immune system.<br /><br />4) Longer lasting energy without insulin levels being adversely affected. Fats are the cleanest burning energy for our body. Carbohydrates cause insulin levels to raise and crash, which is what creates the \"\"eat every 3 hours\"\" cravings that so many people this is hunger. Healthy fats"

It's a bit on the sticky side (and I didn't carry it in the sun or in a car...). So either bring along a moist towelette or use a squirt of those towel free hand sanitizers to eliminate sticky finger syndrome. I'd suggest not eating this particular bar while driving because of that. The calories were not too high for this class of food product (190) and the sodium wasn't obnoxious (20mg - I've seen worse), but I wish they'd get the sugars to under 9g (they're 12g).

We walk 5-7 miles a day and my spoiled monster (gotta love him, he's SO cute!) likes to get a treat every 20 minutes or so on a walk (he'd LOVE to get one every minute, but it's not always a dog's life, hehe).<br /><br />When I give him these jerky treats, I tear them into little bits, so he really only gets 1 per trip (he hasn't learned to count or weigh out food yet, lol!).<br /><br />The dog is 6 1/2 now & is of course perfect weight and health due to all that exercise (hasn't hurt me a bit, either).<br /><br />I only feed him natural foods & treats, he's on a holistic, though not raw, diet. If I had the time & storage space, I would feed him what I fed my previous dogs, chicken, broth and brown rice made at home. My 90 pound Weimaraner lived to be 14 1/2 on that diet.<br /><br />I am a major fan of Cesar Millan and after reading Member of the Family I will NEVER feed anything with 'meat byproducts' to my dog again (read it, by law in 20 states it's LEGAL to include euthanized DOGS in dogfood as a meat byproduct (gag!!!)).<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, yes, there is dextrose in the treats, but my dog isn't diabetic and isn't overweight, so I have no problem with it.<br /><br />Is it identical to beef jerky? Probably. I know that I don't eat as healthily as my dog does, though I try.<br /><br />Does my dog bother me when *I* eat beef jerky because I've given him these treats? Nope. Why? Because I never feed my dog from 'my' food, so he doesn't beg at all, ever. That's just a matter of proper training..dogs don't beg from 'the pack leaders'. Although we regularly invite the dog onto the bed, he never even looks at our food if we are snacking in bed.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the treats. Of course, he adores them. I don't know that I would pay this much for them, I also give him Chicken Chips made by another company that cost $9.99 for a huge bag. The ingredients in that one? Chicken. Period. They also make Banana Chicken and Duck Sweet Potato, etc...with no preservatives at all.<br /><br />I got one bag free (thanks Amazon) and I still have most of it because I only give him 1 or 2 max per day. I might buy them again, haven't checked the price for them in Petsmart yet..though I suspect that Amazon is probably a bit cheaper.<br /><br />Be sure to limit treats for any dog who is not regularly exercised.

I drank it in the evening and had no jitters or caffeine-type sleeplessness.<br /><br />When mixed with honey and milk, it reminds me of Thai tea (which is often black tea colored with tamarind and ends up with a similar color to this tea).  I hit their website and checked out the recipes, but preferred to add a bit of vanilla sugar, half and half, and cinnamon.  When I drank it straight, the flavor was kind of earthy and I found the flavor much better hot than after it sat in the press for about 10 minutes.<br /><br />Notes: this beverage is orange-red and will probably stain clothing.

However, I'm a working mom of two who is willing to spend some extra $ for convenience and for the assurance that I am not going to forget that I'm steaming veggies on the stove and leave it on so long that it ruins the organic food I just spent a bunch of money on!  The ease of use, from prep to clean up, is a big plus for me.  Plus, I make small batches, with different combinations every time, so my daughter is getting a better variety of foods on a weekly basis than when I made food for my son (I made large batches of food with the pot/steamer/blender combo for efficiency, and there was only so much room to store it, and only so much time to steam all of the different types of food).  I'm also more likely to make my own food on a consistent basis because of the convenience; in the couple of weeks I've had the Beaba, I've only reached for a jar one time in a pinch.  It takes up very little space as well.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product to someone who is willing to pay a bit more for some added convenience and ease of use.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price tag, but I believe it's been worth it overall.  It seems like a quality product and seems well made.  If the price makes you cringe, just don't get it; you'll get by without it, for sure.  If not, and convenience is important to you, then I would recommend giving it a try."

I normally hate it when people use caps to voice a strong opinion, but for this review, I make an exception. I feel it is my duty as a fellow parent to inform others so they can protect their children from the effects of this product.<br />What some of the other reviewers have written is true: this machine grows mold. The only reason why other reviewers haven't written the same is because they either cannot see the mold, are mistaking the mold for water deposits (or the type of water they used) or are mistaking the mold for food build up (or food accidentally getting into the water reservoir).<br />I ran the vinegar cleaning through it so many times, I was sure it boiled out any kind of buildup that could possibly be in there, but I was wrong. I do not believe you can ever fully rid the reservoir of every last trace of mold and no matter what you use to clean it (though I would doubt anyone would use anything more harsh than vinegar or anything edible because of the purpose of the water reservoir), it will come back.<br />I am worried that parents have trusted that this \"\"cleaning\"\" gets this clean and sterile for continued use.<br />I also noticed decay of some kind on the side vent"

373875,B004WTHCO2,A7KFC7SLVND0,HuberNat,11,14,3,1299456000,I have a solution to the black mold problem in the Beaba!,"Like most of you, I noticed the black mold problem and was horrified. I tried the vinegar solution to no avail. Then, I got to thinking....Why not try CLR! CLR is a green solution to rid your home or coffeemaker of calcium, lime or rust. I figured if it is safe to use in a coffeemaker then, why not give it a try!<br />It WORKED!! I put in about a 1/2 cup of the product (undiluted)into the water reservoir, let it sit a few minutes and THEN scrubbed the inside with a toothbrush. Keeping the CLR in the reservoir, I ran the unit to steam, the black mold particles started pouring out.<br />Then, I ran it several times with plain water. Particles kept coming. I took a look inside with a flashlight and after a few more touch ups with the toothbrush, the reservoir looked BRAND NEW.<br />For safe keeping I ran it again with more fresh water.<br />In the future, whenever you use your baby food maker, I would recommend emptying out the residual water (this is what caused the mold problem in the first place) then re-attaching the food basket/processor/bowl with the lid on and running the steamer with the LID OFF. You will be able to see the water bubbling, turning to vapor and then the reservoir will be completely dry. This step is KEY as you want to will ensure that your water reservoir is completely dry while you store it. Once this is done, you can re-attach the lid. It's also a good idea that you make sure your food basket/processor/bowl is dry as well.<br />Hope this helps!"
373878,B004WTHCO2,AVV84D436SZEC,OrchDorch,3,3,5,1331510400,A Must Have Baby Item,"I'm a stay-at-home mom with an almost 7 month old.  I got the Babycook as a Christmas gift on recommendation from a coworker of my husband's.  In recent months, this has become my favorite baby item!<br /><br />I'm not a health nut.  I don't have a problem paying for convenience.  But, we figured over the course of a couple kids, this would save us money and would ultimately be healthier.  Little did I know!  It is so simple to use.  Although, the included directions stink and you need to watch a youtube video on it to understand.  But that only takes 3 minutes.  It is so simple to clean.  I was worried about this, but as soon as I've dished out my puree, I rinse the parts.  Then I can either wash right away or leave for when I finish the rest of the dishes.  If I'm making several batches in a row, I rinse and reuse.<br /><br />So the real kicker for me was when my larger-than-average son wasn't interested in solids.  I thought rather than using my Babycook, I'd just buy a couple of jars to start with to see what he liked.  He hated it all.  I wasted so much jar food because once opened it only lasts a day or two.  Then I decided just to whip up whatever fruits and veggies we had in the fridge with my Babycook.  I started with pears and carrots.  He loved both!  I'd even tried both from the jar and he had refused.  The taste difference is very distinct because of the freshness.<br /><br />I also love that I can choose the portion without wasting any of the food.  After I make a batch of whatever in my Babycook, I freeze the puree in classic Rubbermaid ice cube trays.  Once they are frozen, I pop them out and store them in plastic bags in the freezer.  Each ice cube is about an ounce, whereas jarred food is often in 4oz tubs.  My son doesn't even come close to eating 4 ounces at a sitting yet.  So I only thaw what I know he can eat.<br /><br />Making a batch doesn't take long, but I also love that it doesn't confine me to the kitchen.  If I start a batch steaming and then get pulled away to my child, the machine shuts off when it's ready and waits for me to come back.  No problem.  I tend to do a couple batches at once, and then go several weeks without needing to make any more.  For scale, one sweet potato made about 22oz of food and a pear made about 10oz.  Considering the sweet potato cost me about 80cents, I figured the savings was pretty decent.<br /><br />I'm very glad my husband's coworker suggested this, because I would have never considered making my own baby food.  Now I love it.  And I honestly believe if I can do it, anyone can."

Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been.

He was so excited to give them to his friends. We opened them on February 12 to start addressing them. The first disappointment was to find that although the box advertises 32 cards in four designs, there were only two designs in our box--28 C3POs/R2D2s and 4 Darth Mauls. There were no Darth Vaders or Yodas. This felt like false advertising, as one would assume that in a box of 32 cards, you would receive 8 of each of the 4 designs printed on the box. The second disappointment was to realize that although the box shows a picture of a white area on which to address the Valentine's cards, the actual valentines are small, clear plastic bags with no white space on which to write. There is clear crimping (where the package is heat sealed) that has To: and From: tinily printed on it. Even with a sharpie, we were unable to write legibly on the small crimped plastic area. This also felt like false advertising, as one would assume the product would look like the picture on the box. The third disappointment was to realize that the lollipops are made in China.

I'm not quite sure what ingredient used in this blend gave it such an overwhelming, almost chemical, cherry flavor but nothing about it was good. Aside from being able to see that there were other ingredients in this blend, I would've assumed it was exclusively synthetic cherry flavoring. I love green teas, I even love to steep my teas for extended periods of time and never worry about straining the loose leaf ingredients, maybe these were faults of mine that made this tea so horrible but I tried over and over to brew it and even mix it with other teas I have to make it tolerable. The best result I got was taking a small pinch of this tea and adding it to a full glass of another to achieve a flavor akin to a Lysol disinfectant spray."

I could probably rekindle their interest by adding fresh catnip to the surface.<br /><br />During the week, the scratcher moved around a lot, often ending on its side, as the kittens played with it and played through the openings in its sides.  The smaller kitten could fit her head into the opening.  Considering this is normal cat behavior, the scratcher should be a little heavier to keep it from falling over so easily.<br /><br />The kittens loved the toy inside the opening especially, which was a paper poof on a string, and dragged the scratcher around by the string.  But the toy tore loose within 3 days.<br /><br />Overall, a very good design and a decent value.  The cats enjoyed it, but it could be heavier, and the toy inside the base could be sturdier."

Normally, I drink herbal tea with no sweetener, or I occasionally drink a cup of black tea.

Strawberries add a light fruity acid to the tea and natural sweetness, so this takes away some of the tannic bitterness of green tea.<br /><br />Green tea has antioxidants, 1 cup of tea has the equivalent antioxidant properties of 2 apples. Strawberries have phenols --primarily anthocyanin, the colored components of fruits that also provide health benefits.

I found myself constantly flipping the cap to take another whiff whenever I went to the fridge.

I didn't realize everyone liked it as much as I did till they weren't in the mood for this last cake. Normally its breakfast and afternoon snack for everyone, sometimes even a nibble before bed.

CRF is common in cats, especially male cats due to their intricate urinary system. About a year ago we discovered Weruva & started adding various flavors along with their high quality dry food. My cats totally loved their new canned foods especially Out Back Grill, Asian Fushion and Mack & Jack which happen to be all seafood based. I did not know that a seafood diet is not good for cats. Fish can contribute to urinary tract problems in cats. My cat that had CRF was a slim, but normal weight for his small size, but had lost weight partly due to his high fish diet (I found out fish based cat foods do not contain the fat they need). Wuruva, Tiki Cat,Tiki Cat King Kamehameha Luau Variety Pack Canned Cat Food 12/2.8-oz cans etc are all low fat. Cats need animal fat like chicken fat, fish oil, even emu oil. Besides being needed for their overall health, it's important for their kidneys! Not that I know of any onion eating cats, but I also learned never to give any onion to your cat. Deli (sandwich meat)& some meats (ham, hot dogs) may contain onion powder. The vegetable broths in canned tuna may contain onion. Read the label on any broth (including chicken, beef) as most contain onion or \"\"spices\"\". Occasional tuna water from a can of tuna packed in water is okay from what I've read & that is something I have given my cats. Also"

It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell."

We needed to rush him to the emergency room where they induced vomiting and then monitored closely for 2 days at home until he threw it up on his own .... After surfing the internet we found numerous other claims with people having the same issue- some even needing to spend a few thousand on procedures to remove the ball.

Maybe it's convenient for training; instead of carrying a bag of treats, you can just pop this thing in your pocket.

Carolina Style Barbecue.,"Compared to barbecue in the rest of the United States, Carolina-style barbecue is a whole different animal.  Literally.  While most people think of beef dripping a thick, sticky sauce, Carolina Barbecue is shredded, pulled or chopped pork in a spicy vinegar sauce.  You can make the delicious Southern staple at home with a bottle of Scott's Barbecue Sauce.<br /><br />Scott's Barbecue Sauce is based in Goldsboro, North Carolina.  The vinegar-based sauce packs a lot of punch for something that looks so thin.  The punch is in the secret blend of spices that add a bit of hit and lots of flavor to your slow-cooked pork. Don't be surprised if the herbs and spices have settled to the bottom inch of the bottle, just shake it up and you're ready to go.<br /><br />Baste your pig in this vinegary sauce while it cooks.  This can be done in the oven or on the grill with a shoulder or butt.  Basting will give you the maximum infusion of flavor.  You can also add the sauce to the mixture after it has cooked (which many people do in addition to the basting).  The result is a slightly tangy, mildly hot, delicious melt-in-your-mouth pork experience that you have to taste to fully appreciate.<br /><br />The standard bottle size for Scott's Barbecue Sauce is 16 ounces.  The sauce does not contain any sugar or fat.  The ingredients are secret, so the bottle gives the minimal required list of ingredients as vinegar, salt, pepper and spices.  My title alludes to the origins of the sauce, which founder Adam Scott claims was given to him in a dream.  With this recipe, he began making the sauce back in 1917.<br /><br />If you like good Carolina Barbecue (Eastern style), you are certain to enjoy Scott's Barbecue Sauce.  Five finger-licking stars."

That being said, these are pretty good in their own right.<br /><br />TASTE<br />I rather like the way these pizza crusts taste after being toasted up.  They soak in flavor from sauce or cheese well, without becoming soggy or wilted.  They have a good bread flavor on their own, also, and make a good base for a BBQ chicken or BBQ pulled pork pizza.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br />I think the texture is the only thing I can complain about with these - the Schar Crusts are a little more dense than I would like.  However, this is a usual complaint about all gluten-free items.<br /><br />SIZE<br />These are definitely personal pizza sized.  With sauce, cheese, and toppings on this crust, I can usually eat about 1/2 to 3/4 of a pizza on my own.<br /><br />USES/ VERSATILITY<br />If you can expand your mind beyond making just pizza with red sauce and mozzarella, then these crusts are quite useful.

Running in warm weather puts extra demands on runners, including the need to replenish electrolytes and hydrate more frequently. Gatorade G2 is an excellent way to do this. Unlike regular Gatorade, which is filled with sugar, a 20oz bottle of G2 has only 12g of sugar, which is more than sweet enough for me. It also has enough electrolytes to supplement the electrolyte tablets by Hammer Nutrition (which I have reviewed on Amazon) that I take before I head out in warmer weather.<br /><br />At the beginning of my run I pour a 20 oz.chilled bottle of G2 into my Smart Source stainless steel water bottle (which I have reviewed on Amazon), and then place that in a Nathan Quickdraw (which I have reviewed on Amazon) to carry the bottle. A 20 oz bottle usually lasts me about an hour in really hot weather, after which I buy another 20 oz bottle at a convenience store on my route for my second hour of running.<br /><br />Drinking G2 is far superior to drinking plain water to hydrate because besides electrolytes, you get carbohydrates and potassium.<br /><br />I have tried different flavors and the Orange is one of my favorites. I buy a pack of 8 at my local supermarket on sale for six dollars.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a great drink for runners in warm weather. Shop for price."

Well, this one just doesn't taste like the pink salts I've had in the past. Upon tasting, I also I realized that this salt is just 'too pink' for me to believe that it is not enhanced in some way! I've never seen this salt look that way before...but hey, it is entirely possible that it is truly that color without additives...so I went to the source and wrote the company to find out. That was weeks ago, and they never bothered to respond. So I am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a Himalayan pink sea salt. What's funny is, on every container of salt I've ever purchased there is an ingredients list...NOT on this one. (If it's pure, then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient...the salt. But sometimes, even in sea salt, there is an added anti-caking agent added so it will be listed there.)

Open the flavor packet and add to the frying noodles, but not all of it the powder should absorb into the butter and moisture, and glaze the noodles.  Add your own beef, chicken or pork, green onions, and other vegetables to taste and allow the spice packet to coat the meat as well as the stir-fry noodle.

For the teethers, it's helpful to place a few pouches in the fridge.  For the picky eaters, it's helpful for us to administer a swig of this inbetween bites.  These pouches are much better than giving pure juice and aren't messy.  If you do give them the pouches to eat on their own, just be wary that they may squeeze too hard and up comes all of the food.  The screw on top helps if they don't finish it all.  Just place it into the fridge for the next day or later or if you're out, pace it back into your diaper bag with a cold pack.

I used the Whey Low D (for diabetics) in the cupcakes and Whey Low powder for the icing.  Both products certainly performed better than Splenda (and even the Splenda for Baking sugar/splenda blend).  It looks and tastes like sugar in the cupcake recipe.  It baked up beautifully and browned nicely.  I was very pleased with the Whey Low D's performance in the cupcake.<br /><br />The Whey Low Powder at first looked like it was going to make great butter cream icing, but after spreading it on the cupcakes, it began to loosen up and turned into a thick glaze after a short while.  The taste is sweet, but the icing was grainy in texture.  Within a few hours, the icing had begun to run a bit down the sides of the cupcakes and by morning it was a wet puddle at the bottom of each cupcake.  So, it did not perform like ordinary powdered sugar in this recipe.  I think it would work fine for making a glaze or for dusting the top of a cake, but not for a real cake frosting.  Also, I would suggest eating it within a few hours of application, otherwise it will break down and be a mess.  The results were quite disappointing and only slightly better than Splenda in this type of recipe.<br /><br />The unfortunate news is that the mini cupcakes did raise my blood sugar to some degree, so you can't expect your blood sugar to not be affected.  I ate three mini cupcakes for my test, then I checked my blood every 30 minutes for about 1½ hours and it went steadily up from 150 to 202.  Whey Low declares that it's 70% lower in calories than regular sugar, which may still make it a good choice for cakes and cookies over using regular sugar if you want to make a special dessert, such as a birthday cake once a year.  But I don't plan to replace Splenda in most of my cooking because of my blood sugar results.  NOTE: Ordinarily, I wouldn't have eaten three mini cupcakes in one sitting, but I did this time because I wanted to see how my blood sugar would react to a larger dose of the Whey Low in what might be a normal serving of cake (and one mini cupcake wouldn't have been large enough).<br /><br />Whey Low is not the miracle I hoped it would be, but I'm glad to know of an alternative to Splenda for baking cakes and other baked pastry sweets.  I very rarely make them, but on my birthday or at Christmas I do like to have a piece of cake and have it taste \"\"normal.\"\"  I will reserve Whey Low for these rare"

The only difference in taste between this Cappuccino drink and the Starbucks Latte Primo is that the coffee flavor is slightly stronger in the Starbucks product. Also, with the Cappuccino you brew the coffee first and then use the milk disc. With the Starbucks Latte Primo you brew the milk first then the coffee.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a bargain buy. As long as you are not looking for a slightly stronger coffee flavor, I'd suggest purchasing this instead of the Starbucks brand as both products use expresso coffee and milk discs."

The smell of the tea bags reminded me of orange antacid tablets (Tums, anyone?).  I figured I would still give it a try, since tea doesn't always taste like it smells.  I was correct.  The tea tasted nothing like Tums; in fact, it had no taste at ALL.  I was relieved that I didn't have to drink tums in the form of tea, but the complete lack of taste wasn't much better.  It's rare that I dislike a tea enough to actually come onto Amazon and type a negative review like this, but this tea definitely qualifies.  I enjoy a lot of other Lipton tea - including the Island Mango & Peach, and Blueberry Pomegranate, but this tea does not fall under the category of good Lipton teas by a long shot.

It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo."

This is one of my favorite spices. Like other reviews have said, it is not extremely potent, nor is it spicy, but if you like to cook from scratch and add lots of different spices to your food, this is a great complimentary spice to almost anything. It works well in pasta sauce, chicken dishes, soup, beef, and so many other things. It is more of an herb blend than a garlic/onion blend, which is nice if you like to add fresh garlic and onions or have more potent garlic/onion powder separately. The other nice feature is that it doesn't contain any salt, so if you are looking to add additional flavor to already salty items like canned soup or a box of mac n' cheese this works great. A few of the spice blends I like to use already contain salt and the fact that I can use this spice in combination with them without creating an overly salty dish is wonderful. I do think you can use a much larger quantity of this spice than many others. I wasn't sure just how much I liked this spice until I ran out and my local market stopped carrying it. My lasagna tasted different, even though this was the only spice missing, and I started to notice that all my dishes tasted a little different. Now that I have my spice back I'm so happy.

I have brewed an entire box of this already and have tried it both hot and cold. First off, the packaging is first rate. It's a class act, looks like you spent a lot of money. Each tea bag is individually wrapped in a sort of plastic/foil, and are incredibly easy to open. The tea bag istelf is quite large, but holds a small amount of tea. It's not like those lipton teabags everyone knows - full of tea up to the brim. It is strong tea, but I would recommend 2 bags per cup at least for regular strength. You only should let it steep for 3-4 minutes. The box says no milk should be added and I totally agree. That would really detract from the taste. Often, milk is added to quell bitterness of the tannin in tea but this tea I suppose has none or very little. It's a very fragant cup, almost too much (of course I am using 2 bags per cup). It's like inhaling a spring day. I'd say this will be a cup of tea you would want without food as this sweet flowery taste and aroma will overpower any food you might be eating.

Green tea has been my good buddy since 1998 when my sister introduced me to it, but I have to say goodbye. Oolong tastes better than green tea as well (at least the Bigelow brand does anyway).<br /><br />Being over 40 I was looking for something natural to increase my metabolism without downing extra caffeine. Although Oolong has caffeine in it, it doesn't have as much as coffee. Oolong doesn't give me heart palpitations like coffee does.<br /><br />I start my morning off with this tea and it keeps me from taking a nap or becoming sleepy around 1 or 2 p.m. as I usually do. As a matter of fact, if I'm looking forward to relaxing and curling up for a good nap, I have to remember not to drink any oolong.<br /><br />Bigelow is by far the best tasting Oolong I've had. I have an organic brand that I regret buying as it tastes horrible. I couldn't even finish one cup of that stuff. I'd give Oolong by Bigelow more than 5 stars if I could. I recommend it over coffee and for those of us who need more energy throughout the day.

(Eight dollars for a one ounce bottle of stuff with no flavor?  No thank you.)<br /><br />So I started looking around for an alternative and found that Mapleine is still available.  I didn't know they still made this stuff.  My parents used to use this in the 50s; I grew up on it.<br /><br />Use the recipe on the box to make your own maple flavored syrup.  The end result, you wind up with something that tastes at least as good as store bought (I'd say a lot better) and you actually know what's in it.  Want your syrup a little thicker; add some corn syrup to the mix.  I like a little stronger maple flavor so I use a little more flavoring than the recipe calls for.<br /><br />You have to buy a box of six bottles, that's a lot, but the stuff has a long shelf life and it doesn't take up too much storage room.  I can do that.<br /><br />Bottom line: great stuff, I'm glad they still make it."

So when you eat it causes a horrid cramping pain under your right ribs) I stopped eatting...anything. Which is pretty bad too. Then I started trying different bars and found that many cause my Fatty liver to hurt bad until I ran onto these. Many of the bars are based in chocolate which is not my go to food even before I was diagnosed. So I am always looking for tasty bars OTHER then chocolate.<br />The Orange Smoothie Nugo bar and the Vannilla Yogurt Nugo bars fit that bill well. The round rice things are softer and smaller then most bars which is better for me. They have a light sweet flavor that is very tasty and not alot of sugar substitutes/fat(which a low functioning liver can NOT process well). I think they are marketed to diabetics and I would totally reccomend them to anyone with that condition as well.<br />I wish they sold them more locally and maybe at a better price but hey you can't have everything!!<br /> It is good with coffe in the morning(VERY hard for me to eat in the am but have to if I want to keep my blood sugar balance and metabilizum going all day) I add a piece of fruit or as a snack with water....or to replace a weak moment where you'd break out the candy bars...you just break out the orange smoothie bar!!<br /><br />So if you are looking for a tasty nutritonal bar that is fruity vs chocolaty then this IS the bar to buy!!<br />I thank you for reading and I hope you have a happy healthy day:)"

Kinda like mothballs.  I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination.  I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund just for the strange smelling items (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable).  She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again.  Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one of the same thing since I'd never ordered from them before.  (Note:  I only wanted a refund for the unopened bags of the item in question.  I did not ask to return anything else in the order.)<br /><br />I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same.  Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site.  While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me.<br /><br />I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc.  Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried.  I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective.<br /><br />NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar.  They are also available here on Amazon.com.<br />Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />-I ordered a wide variety of things, including this item:  erythritol, xylitol, gum, candy, etc.  It included this item and a lot of other things.<br />-I asked only for money back on items I tried that were suspect as being defective, and then only for the items I had not opened.<br />-I asked the manufacturer if the items were safe to consume, given the very odd odor some of them emitted.<br />-My review concerns primarily the customer service problems I had, as well as the concern with the origin of their products I had ordered in general.<br /><br />Personally I think it is odd that when I called to return a small part of a rather large order that the customer service rep did not want to honor the guaranteed refund posted on the web site.  She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing.  How was I to know the substance would smell so badly?  She said I should have just ordered one.  What difference does it make since I had only opened one?  The others were perfectly sealed.  She said she would take them back after much ado, and then said they would never accept another order from me.  (Like I would anyway after that).<br /><br />If you have had a good encounter with their customer service, I am happy for you.  That was not my experience.  They should not post a guaranteed refund when they don't mean it."

I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)"

Treats are perfect, though!","As is true with most gluten-free versions of popular products, you will be disappointed if you're expecting gluten-free Rice Krispies to taste and behave exactly like the original.  Snap, Crackle & Pop are in delightfully full force.  Using brown rice instead of the standard white rice is a nice healthier touch but adding sugar to the recipe isn't; these changes do make the cereal taste a little different, though it by no means has become anything resembling a sugary cereal.  Gluten-free Rice Krispies turn to mush in milk much faster -- but is it really a problem to eat it quickly?  I don't think so.<br /><br />I have nothing negative to say about the treats.  Adding the butter and marshmallows makes it exactly like it was when I was a kid, especially if extra marshmallows are added.  They are incredibly moreish, taste and act exactly like the original and do not last very long around my home.  The Kellogg's website also has recipes for peanut butter treats and seasonal Gluten Free Tree Trimmer Treats.

From their side the calories were pretty close to their claim and the fat content was almost right on, but they didn't use the legal serving size.  They've corrected the label and have to do periodic testing as part of the settlement.  The correction isn't that far from what they originally claimed, but some users of the dressings claim the taste is different, worse, and they must have changed their recipe to make the calories/fat match the labels.  My own experience is that this is still a low-cal dressing and I still really like the taste.  I couldn't really tell a taste difference unless I had an old bottle to compare side-by-side, assuming it is actually different.  The plus for us is that we now know the label is correct, maybe even more reliably so than most other dressings.  So try it and like it, or don't.  I do still suggest not buying by the case, it just doesn't last long enough.  Also watch expiration dates in store carefully, lots of stores not good about rotating and this still isn't a big seller so it's more likely to sit longer.  I'm buying it though.

I tried several different kinds of bread before my colleague told me I absolutely HAD to try Udi's bread. So off I went to whole foods to spend nearly $8 on a loaf of bread. I was so excited to try it, but I was extremely let down. First, the pieces of bread are roughly the size of children's plastic play food. They are ridiculously tiny! Second, the slices, even after they are heated/thawed, have the feel and taste of styrofoam. It's  very bland (in my opinion) and the texture is just revolting. I am dying for a squishy piece of bread that is large enough for an actual sandwich. I will absolutely keep searching though, because I believe there has got to be something better out there."

It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice."

At all. And especially in these cruel and seemingly-endless winters. It's a fabulous idea and saves running to the bodega in the scary 'hood at midnight when I realize that my princely master (I have learned that the adage -- 'people have dogs and cats have people' is all-too-true, though I am struggling to remain in charge) is out of food. I also seem to really love parenthetical asides, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />Anywho,(here's *that* thing) when I received my first shipment and realized that this was far more than my cat (this is my first cat, a stray whom I had no choice but to take in -- so I am new at cat-ism, previously being a dog person) would eat in a month, I immediately logged in to change the frequency and/or amount of the auto-ship order and it seems my only option is to cancel. This is pesky and bothersome because that leaves me with two choices, as I see it; cancel the auto-ship, or, let the cat food pile up till I have enough cat food to last a year and then cancel. So I give the product 5 stars because my finicky little Prince Wonderfluff loves it and it is healthy and free of the chemicals which are all-too-present in food in this country, but I think Amazon needs to fix the auto-ship options so that when you click on the impending subsequent shipment, you can make such changes to frequency and amount. There may be an existing way to do this but I can't figure it out and I make web sites for a living so I can generally figure out how to do such things.<br /><br />I suppose a third option is to contact Amazon Customer Service but that's not a quick and easy task and I am busy trying to maintain order and earn a living."

399209,B000VK4K3W,A1AQKOELZ9NY12,R. Gordon,3,4,1,1266710400,Different Consistency,We have 6 cats and 2 dogs presently and they all get Newman's Own Organics.  The only one we have had our cats walk away from is the 3 oz can of Turkey Formula for cats.  They love the 5.5 oz. can of Turkey and the other two selections.  They also love the 3 oz. chicken and salmon.  The only difference besides the size of the cans is that in the middle of the turkey formula 3 oz. cans there is now a dark pink or reddish colored spot(that was not there originally) that is not in the 5.5 oz can.  All the other dry and can food varieties are very nutritious and are eaten very quickly.
399227,B000VK4K3W,A115HRES7RTR5B,a customer,0,0,4,1339632000,Almost a 5,"I love the can size. I can use one per day rather than covering and refrigerating for the next day.  It is great because this food is supposed to go to the cat at room temperature.  Unfortunately,  I believe I checked when I was considering changing to these smaller cans and found that they are more expensive for the amount my cat eats per day than the larger cans.  The only reason I don't give this product a 5 can be remedied by either Newman's Own or Amazon.  I am a prime member but since subscribe and save does not use prime I have to double order.  There are 24 cans so prime once a month (regular shipping time vs. 2 day prime makes it longer than once a month) won't keep my cat feed for the month.  I don't understand why subscribe and save does not honor prime membership.  When customers choose subscribe and save they are giving Amazon long-term consistent business. I guess if Newman's Own packed 40 or 48 cans it would work better with subscribe and save."

How do I know? I did a blind test and I found it was difficult to tell which was which except for the Starbucks being a little sweeter and bolder but only a very little.<br /><br />My fair rating should be a bland 3-stars (It's Okay).

I would consider these two coffee drinks to be close competitors in price and size.<br /><br />illy's canned issimo coffee drink is very tasty, is sweet but not overly so.  The illy drink is larger by volume (it's 8.45 oz to the Doubleshot's 6.5oz), so the illy drink has a more milky flavor--it also contains cocoa and so tastes a bit sweeter.<br /><br />As to caffeine content, the illy drink has 81mg, whereas the Doubleshot (per its name) has 130mg. So, in the Starbuck's drink you get more caffeine in fewer total fluid ounces. Thus the Starbucks Doubleshot has a stronger coffee taste than the illy issimo.<br /><br />For me then, the illy drink is better tasting however it does not provide as strong a caffeine punch as the Starbucks Doubleshot. Choosing between the two may be a matter of how much caffeine you feel you need at a given time. However on taste alone, illy's issimo beats the Starbucks Doubleshot."

I EAT A MORNING CEREAL WITH DRIED STRAWBERRIES IN IT AND THEY WERE ALWAYS PICKING OUT THE STRAWBERRIES TO EAT.  I BOUGHT 2 TUBS OF STRAWBERRIES, AND THEY WENT THROUGH ONE WHOLE TUB WITH A FEW DAYS.  WILL BE ORDERING THESE AGAIN."

It pops almost flawlessly and is excellent value compared to the name brand kernels I've found locally, which are about $10 for 2 pounds, and a vastly better value than microwave popcorn, which would be -what- $4 for 1 lb 5 oz of kernels?<br /><br />I found only 6 partially or completely un-popped kernels out of a half-cup of kernels.<br />There is no questioning its great poppability. My bag's expiration date is December 2013.<br /><br />My popping tools were basic:<br />Standard aluminum cooking and lid with popcorn oil and a bit of Flavacol.<br /><br />It's the best popcorn I've had. So light and crunchy!"

We have used this popcorn both on the stove top and in our popcorn machine, it can't be beat!  Even better is the customer service at Discount Tommy!  They stand behind absolutely everything they sell!"
